# Text mining project:
## Sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews

This project aims to look at sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews by trying to predict the number of stars that a user gives to a restaurant by analysing the text of their review.
The project will try and compare multiple models:
Naive Bayes, BERT and RoBERTa, as well as test the impact of dataset balance on the results.

The code can be found in Project.ipynb
fetch_dataset.py contains code to try and get the second dataset. It ends up being unused

Restaurant reviews.csv is the original dataset
balanced_reviews.csv is a balanced proportion of entries from a larger dataset not included here

the errors/ folder contains every errors that the models made
