3, 4, "I absolutely love ordering from this place for all special occasions. I make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever I am visiting my parents.
This place is pretty expensive and there’s no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year, it’s so worth it.
I have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but I have tried their sample cakes multiple times and I can’t wait to order them.
Note: they usually need advance orders so give your order on time and they are closed on Sundays so make sure that you call and confirm before making the trip."

We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,
Ambience - 5/5
Dj-5/5
Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Will recommend for partys with friends!!"

4, 3, "Visited Hyderabadi Daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. Surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. Wondered why we have not visited this place before. A definite must visit from me. Keep it up team HD. You rock!!!!"

This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying.."

4, 3, "The food is really good and waiter Narender is very enthusiastic with his work. Ambience is just ok and starters are awesome. Main course is just ok and deserts are available with different varieties. 5star rating for Narendra for his work and service."
3, 2, "Nice ambiance. Food is good to average nothing to write home about ?. My only complaint is the portion size which is a tad smaller for the money u r paying. We ordered hariyali tikka which was too soft n yummy. One crispy fried chicken whose actual name I forgot. Overall a nice experience partly due to the courteous staff but food portion is something that can be looked into."
3, 2, "Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The décor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."
3, 4, "Good food and Great Ambience... Nice place to have Mandi..and this place offers variety of Arabian, Turkish recipes too..Also a great place to take clicks..."

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us."

3, 4, "I had a food session here. The service was very nice and food was nice too. They have this two amazing varieties of soups, Arabianchicken soup and lemon coriander soup, which were amazing. Dragon Chicken and Hariyali fish is a must try. Chiken pahadi was good as well. They have two varieties of Mandi, fish fried mandi and chicken grilled Mandi, the presentation was excellent. I’m in love with the chicken Mandi here. They have a variety of milkshakes and deserts. Kaddu ki kheer was delicious . Lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell."
3, 4, "Awesome Ambience, cheap beers and you can get Kingfisher drought tower in rs 750, ,food is also up to the mark.
Beet part, they allows stack on weekend s."
3, 4, "I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could’ve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you’ll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!"

1, 3, "Grilled chicken is not good"
2, 3, "A nice place to hangout with friends and have drinks.
Must try the brewed beer. I tried the OTM ledger, which was pretty good.

Food wise pizza was pretty good. We ordered the mexican pizza. Along with crispy lotus stem and water chestnuts.

Deducting one star for poor service and lack of staffs which resulted in delay in services."
3, 4, "it is one of the best in gachibowli. it is value for money. the best item i liked is Veg.Biryani and Sambar Rice. I always love to party there."
1, 0, "Nasi Goreng, Kung pao chicken & burnt garlic chicken were really spicy & over powered with chilly flakes! Looked & tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it! The saving grace was the Indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice. Really upset with tonight’s order."
3, 1, "Visited this restaurant thinking to have good food, but the efforts were wasted. We went on a Friday and we started eating the starters. After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.

Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.

Two stars only for the ambience.

Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen."
2, 3, "Tasty food. However wrong chutney was sent"
1, 2, "This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
3, 4, "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
3, 4, "Went for the dinner with the family. All the items were delicious. You must try the firni in deserts.
Dont miss the platter and mouth watering non veg platters."
1, 2, "I'm reviewing a delivery order.

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this."
3, 4, "A decent restaurant with courteous staff and mouth watering Chinese dishes.A good place to go by for Chinese cuisine...sizzler noodles and bamboo rice is a must try for if you can go with less spice!"
3, 4, "One of the best restaurants I have visited in Hyderabad... I like to spend time here whenever I feel like going. The ambience is just awesome. Food is also good but little costly. Drinks are no doubt the best, specially sangria is awesome..."
3, 4, "Am big fan of KS as we are regular customers .we know each and every item and here. They'll take feedback too. And service is slow as crowd was big.. But overall good."
0, 2, "New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."
3, 2, "This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."
4, 3, "I tried the buffet dinner. Very good spread both for vegetarians and non vegetarians . The food was good and the staff were friendly too. Will definitely be going there again. Do check out my blog page for more reviews @s.t.a.s.h on instagram."

1, 2, "Confused waiters.... half order .... items not available.... customization not available... ahhh total chaos.... but surely not truly Chinese... it's more northeast... nepali food as they are more on spicy and oily side. May be I should have tried thupka or some other northeast specialities.
Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed"
3, 4, "It's been a great experience visiting this place. The staff over here ensure that you are served with the best food especially Suraj . When we expressed our concern that the we did not like the grill fish item , they served us fried fish which was not even part of their menu ."
3, 4, "Shah Ghouse is a best place for Hyderabad biryani. Their quality and quantity are really satisfied. They have all the branches with same taste."
3, 4, "One definitely have to try their coconut bun and cream cheese bagels. Bread loafs are so fresh here, and we can get variety of cheese. Super place to hangout."
2, 0, "The ambiance of this place doesn’t justify the price. Severely over priced. Only with Gold is it ok. Would prefer if they thought of their service and ambience and try and compare with other restaurants out there."
3, 4, "This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!"
3, 4, "With great music and ambience the excitement for the final IPL match was enhanced.
The food is great along with the exotic drinks.
Must try is the cock in the basket which is fried chicken breast."
3, 4, "We ordered a cake for my Niece birthday.

Loved the Coco Vanilla cake. This place is so classy/ The guy on tills is very decent and friendly. Will surely come back."
3, 4, "Good and yummy food. We ordered Murgh Dhaniya shorba soup which was so delicious followed with Lal Mirchi teeka tikka which was tender and juicy. Mutton Tawa Biryani is no less compared to others. Will visit again."
4, 3, "Went here on last friday. I didn't knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went. Food here was Awesome. I had ordered for Dahi Kebab and it was outstanding. The food presentation and quality and taste all were good ... Would certainly love to visit this place again...!!! Hope they keep continuing their good work."
3, 4, "Good ambience.. Great food.. Well I would say best Parathas out there in the area. Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need."
0, 1, "Food is really very disappointing. Kheema pulao had many chicken pieces and rice was cooked very bad. Even kheema was not prepared well.awful experience"
2, 1, "Heyy veggies!! Good ambience!!
Food I should say is not so appealing...very tough to recommend or think of any standout...Butter Roti is good in breads
Service is good I should say...
Let's talk about Don't Trys:
Manchow Soup
Mushroom Starters (as a mushroom fan..disappointment)
This place would be in my choices with hangouts as priority and not food"
4, 3, "Ordered classic waffle from the foodie monster kitchen, Gachibowli and it was so yummm! Beautiful balanced taste, no overpowering egg smell, a little crisp outside and soft and fluffy inside. Plus, the prices are also reasonable. Good find, will order from here again."
2, 1, "Food is not that much tasty and moreover limited items,limited deserts ,its ok for one time lunch/dinner enjoyed in playing hand football..."
3, 4, "We have gone for office party
Food was excellent
Service was also good
They have options for rooftop party
We have chosen AC hall it had 45 people capacity
Overall good experience"
3, 2, "I am giving 3 star out of 5 to mustang just for roof top ambience where i was able to drink in between the glowing city lights ... Restaurant should work on customer service more ..."
0, 1, "Absolutely overhyped place. Substandard biryani and kababs, totally dry and tasteless. No dress code for waiters, hardly any waiters anyway. Pathetic service. I guess each and every place in Hyderabad, which is being talked about, be it pista house or paradise, are totally over hyped."
4, 3, "good"
3, 4, "Went there on a Friday, we were only stags but we went there early, at about 6pm. The environment was very energetic, we had great conversations until night and then went to the dance floor. The DJ was amazing, a good mix of English and Hindi songs. Had one of my best night outs here! It was a little on the expensive side though, for 3 people the bill was 9k rs."
3, 2, "I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don’t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items."
3, 2, "quantity of starters was less"
3, 4, "Best paratha you can get in Hyderabad in Gachibowli !! It’s little expensive but 10/10 for food for value !!

Note : Don’t eat paratha if you are on diet !! 😅"
2, 1, "Felt like i was attending a marriage reception on a saturday night. This place has changed quite a lot over the years or maybe the timing was not right!"
4, 3, "I was waiting since long to visit this place. One fine breezy evening I’ve been here for dinner. Great spacious and open space to sit and chill for long. I can say great ambience to sit and relax near to outer ring road. Space is great, customer service was too good, food is delicious. Must try sea food space for fish ...
Food :4.5

0, 1, "It was a bad experience. Worst part was when we entered the places and there was this pathetic smell to welcome us. Another issue, you can't just order anything from the menu because maximum number of items were not available.

The food was smelling too.

I ordered "Steam Naga Fish".

If u really want to eat, get a mask(suggestion)."

3, 4, "My friend ordered the Ulavacharu Chicken Bone Pulao from T-Grill. The price was high, but the taste justified it. It is one of the spicier foods I tried in Hyderabad. I always though Hyderabadi food was spicy. But, I never came across anything very spicy. This one was spicy enough to be memorable. It's one of the best pulaos I've ever had. You will definitely love it."
3, 4, "Ordered Meals(Dal makhni + Rice + roti + Aloo Gobhi). Tastes really good and was fulfilling too. Just one thing, if you could include some plastic cutlery, So that we can pour curries into the bowls. It is difficult to manage this in office without cutlery."
3, 4, "Went to this place for lunch. Opted for a Set Menu with the on going Dim Sun Festival. Soup was good. Dim sums were awesome and they served a wide variety of Bao, Gyoza, Dim Sum, Wonton. Main Couse was ok with Rice and Noodles. Desert was Fried Banana in Caramel Sauce with ice cream. Desert was good as well.

Loved the place, it was spacious and the ambiance was really good. The first thing I ordered was coffee but they were not serving any hot beverages. Next wanted to try pizza as they serve in different shapes but that too was unavailable. Did not felt like ordering anything after this. Highly disappointed."
3, 4, "Well if atall I am in Gachibowli area in lunch times or dinner times...my mind like a magnet asks me to get into this cozy bistro. Each thin slices of pizza wid toppings of olive oil and chilli flakes is all you need for your mid day motivation.
Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
Zomato gold is always an add on benifit .
Every time I go to this place...I come out happy tummy n happy soul .."

As for the quantities served and the price, wouldn't really be keen on visiting too often."

Loved the fried eggs and tea in the combo"
2, 3, "This bakery is present in a prime location.
The ambience and seating are great.
But the food lacks in taste.
I tried blueberry cake and 🍄 mushroom makhni 🥪 sandwich here, neither of which was upto the mark.
Still, it's a great place to hangout with friends."

Quantity was huge for one person if u r going with biryani, plan for two people"
3, 2, "Pocket friendly, sumptuous and decent quality.

This place is my goto for late night deliveries. Their Kaju Biryani is a personal favorite.

Well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter, this one is comfort at its best.

Their other options are good too and the helping is perfect for two."

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."

2, 1, "This was our second stop in same complex on Saturday (30/03) evening. Only reason I am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by GM of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla."

Milky way had shredded chicken combined with creamy mayo and a cheese slice. This is a must have for anyone with a craving for cheesy and creamy burgers.. Thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice.. The burger just melts in your mouth.. Must visit place for bbq lovers.."

Recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha. They serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni.

The service is very slow so you need to be really active to ensure that your order is through."

A quaint little place opposite SLN Terminus, this joint serves authentic Tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover's delight. We had ordered Minty Cucumber in mocktails, a Korean appetizer Tangsuyuk, Kalbi Bokum, Smoked Pork fried with Bamboo Shoots and Teriyaki Chicken. All the dishes tasted good, the Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet though.
Would love to visit again and try out their other delicacies."

1, 2, "I have ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. Their online menu says it's their signature cake. It was the worst cake I ate till date. It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.
I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake."

They have different flavours to pic from. We had alfanso, fruit exotica and ferrero rocher. Exquisite desserts with unique taste. I loved the alphanso. They chopped these mangos over the yummy icecream.
Highly recommended. 😇"

Ambiance- 3.5/5
It has a black theme with modern crafty ceilings & is dimly lit but not dark. One of the pleasant ambiance around that area, best for evenings with friends/ colleagues. The seating was not very comfortable. They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!
Overall the food was good but can be improved.

Service- 4/5
Very attentive staff who handled 15 people in a very decent and cordial way.

Overall do visit this place for with friends/ colleagues and enjoy the drinks and music!"

3, 2, "Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.
My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes."

3, 2, "This one is near to paradise gachibowli. The ambience is decent and the service is fine. We tried the pepper chicken for starters and then for main course, we tried kolhapuri paneer with butter naan and tandoori roti. Pepper chicken but the quantity was too less for their price. Either the quantity or price could be changed. Main course was fine, especially butter naan was really nice."
1, 2, "I went there last Sunday. Had a buffet. Honestly I didn't like the food taste and quality of vegetable and specially non-veg items. It tasted stale. No doubt service is good , staff is always smiling. But they need to improve a lot on food quality. Even the biryani was not up to the mark. Moreover the chicken was undercooked or old, our stomach felt funny when we reached home."
2, 3, "Was late at work, stomach was growling, like a wailing siren of an ambulance, indicating an emergency to fill it up. At this moment there was a row of places for the mind to choose from, Urban Asia it was.
Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers."

3, 4, "This place came with high recommendations from a food expert in the industry for the last two decades or so.

Visited Zing’s Northeast Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I wasn’t disappointed at all. We ordered for :

Roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. The lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

Deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. The pork melted in the mouth. Beautifully prepared 5/5

Steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. A weekend special !! 5/5

Kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

Dotsol Bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. A special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

All downed with non-alcoholic (Coolberg) beer.

Honest food prepared with a lot of passion. Absolute value for money. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations."

Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup."

The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.
We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.
Thoroughly disappointing.
Ambience is the only saving grace for this place.

The cinderella mock-tail was insanely sweet, no one at our table could finish it. Despite promising us for over an hour to find us an indoor table, they sat us outdoor with the mosquitos which they weren’t able to control with citronella sticks. The dance floor was very active with an amazing DJ, though not nearly enough AC so it smelled like sweaty guys."

Low crowd made us feel even more comfortable.
Attractive and romantic ambience..
Tasty food and very much reasonable...
Good service..
I had chicken breast steaks with mashed potatoes and salad 😋 unexpectedly so good taste.
If you are a pasta lover, then do order white sauce pasta.
It tasted incredibly hot and yummy.
As we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
We wrapped up having sea salt Nutella dessert which was heaven of Nutella and different taste.
In recent times I've never been to such a good place with decent crowd and tastyyyy food.
I agree that prices are high but I forgot about the price when I had one spoon of food.

Do visit this place with your loved ones I bet you will have a perfect date."

Choose any other place."

The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes."

Went with my wife today by seeing the 3.9 stars. The place is small and too much crowded. There are very less number of servers compared to footfalls.

Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

Closing line... Best hangout place in Gachibowli area."

The packing of this was excellent which came in a box packing using aluminum foil covering for paratha and every other thing well settled in the box. Overall it was okay with the accompaniments and more than sufficient for one person."

Must trys - corn cubes
Turn offs - extremely slow service, desserts

FOOD - 3.5/5 - tried corn cubes, crispy potato with butter chilli garlic sauce, paneer lababdar, mint and lemon Ice cream.

Corn cubes 5/5 - one of their unqiue dishes. Simply loved it. A highly recommended starters you need to try here.

Crispy Potato 4/5 - tasty and light!

Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.

Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.

Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.

AMBIENCE 4/5 - decent ambience for a family dining..

SERVICE 2/5 - extremely slow. Had to remind 2-3 times to get our order. This definitely has to be improvised."

Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate."

This review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time."

They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.
You would find plethora of coffee. It is paradise for a black coffee person.The way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.You are the best,Driven cafe.You have my heart.

People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again"

There was a set menu, Welcome Drink(very refreshing) tomato Shorba(passable),crispy paneer, chicken tikka (both were very yummy) , butter chicken, paneer butter masala( both passable) , daal fry (yummy) roti (soft) and steamed rice.The pasta in white sauce was good.. But the absolute let down was the pan seared fish with tomatoes. The fish was not done properly, no crispy skin and was a bit smelly. There was ice-cream too.. The service was amazing and so was the ambiance."

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!"

The ambience is good but the service, quality and quantity of food is amazing. We had soup which was good and as a part of starters we had ginger chicken which was really amazing.
For main course we had hakka noodles with chicken in spicy black bean sauce and mongolian chicken. I must say all of them were really amazing and had a great quantity and quality is beyond words.
Then in desert we had chocolate mousse and chocolate volcano with vanilla ice cream.
Mousse was good but the volcano was really really good.
I would say a must place to go if you are looking for good chinese food and are bored with Mainland China 😂😂"

1, 2, "#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."
3, 2, "Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"

Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.

Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

Must try: Forest mushroom soup, Crispy corn pepper salt, Quattro Formaggi, Tiramisu

Would actually give it a 4.5/5"

Not at all worth, checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed."

A super-hit club of Jubilee Hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit

Cheers!"

3, 4, "Though the brand's famous for donuts, I'd have to start the review with their Burger. After having got bored with McD, KFC and other popular burger places, DD's burgers are just stunning. Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

2, 3, "I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."

Ambience: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
One of the best places with great ambience in the city. The place is dim lighted but not too dark. It's the perfect place to hang out in the evening for a drink.

Food: 🌟🌟🌟
The place will serve you with a good buffet. A series of starters and main courses and desserts are just awesome here. Just make sure you are not late as the buffet strictly closes at 3:00 pm.

Hospitality: 🌟🌟🌟🌟

The staff is well trained to manage the crowd and at making you feel good."

3, 4, "Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.

One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.

Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!

We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!

Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!

Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!

Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!

That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!

I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!

Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!"

Then we tried main course Nalli gosht and Murgh lababdar with bread, Murg musallam and Hyderabadi mutton biryani.
Then the mocktails Virgin mojito, Mojito fantasy(strawberry), coolers(coconut, cucumber, lime, mint), Mango mule, Blue hawaii, Soda fountain.
We ended our day with the desserts Shahi tukda and phirni."

The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.
Update:Went recently on Independence day. The paneery curry was just color and chilli powder. The paneer pieces were also very stiff. The rotis were also very rubbery."

-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

The paneer n the chicken kurkure Momo's are just awesome. I dint try veg so. N also paneer n chicken steam Momo's are very good too. Would love to know the recipe of chicken kurkure Momo's from the Chef. Every body loved it in my office too. Thank you"

3, 2, "Food: 3.5/5
We have ordered
veg manchow soup- it's GOOD
Panner majestic - it was more sour and tangy in taste.
Nijam handi recommended by waiter- it was okay
Panner kulcha - its more salty may be because of butter
Kothimeera butter roti - this one is good and light.

Ambiance:3/5 is alright.
Service :5/5 it was GOOOODD (papu served us)"
1, 2, "The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of "FRESH" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."
3, 4, "Trust it will surely make your innerself more happy. One of the best roof top lounges with such a pleasant ambience, good food and quick service. Nd only complaint is there was no music. They said they have a problem with the socket. But still it's okay. I'll surely visit again"
2, 3, "Ended up this place just before holi and it was a dry day, hardly 2 tables were occupied. Starters were really good specially chicken tikka periperi and main course was good but too oily, biryani disappointed us as there is no masala flavor just topped with paneer tikka pieces. Over all it was Just okay they need to improve on service also as I did not find staff so friendly.

Coming to English bf they have provided fruit bread ,wheat bread and also milk bread and you can toast them also.They gave 2 variety of cakes one pastry and other cup cake. They have also given roasted tomato along with mynassie.One more is crossient and watermelon juice and fruits.

We had gone for Ritviz's show which was a super duper hit. They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well). The ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any."

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

Pretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!"

1, 2, "This was my first time at a "Barbeque Nation." I've heard great things about it, people sounded like they serve food from heaven.
Now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. The service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. They were serving complimentary drinks, I selected ice tea, worst one I've ever had.
The good thing about this place, their "manager," he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.
I liked the ambience of this place, will definitely give another chance to this outlet ✌️"
3, 4, "Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."

My biggest surprise with vada and Bamboo chicken biryani. Vada with chicken curry, bamboo chicken biryani with chicken gravy made my day. Wide variety of desserts are to a special mention. Hotel management is very friendly and helped to make our experience much better. Most recommended place if you are a lover of buffets."

Cost is at the higher end."

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I’d complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush."

One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite. Amit Agrawal Harsh Jhunjhunwala Poorvi Agarwal"

The second time I ordered it, the quantity was very less compared to the first time and tasted different as well.

Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!!

I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took "Rogue" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.
I would really want Club Rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and I think the same was felt by so many people over there."

The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don’t like sweet dishes. May be it’s the authentic Orange Chicken)
All together good experience. Staff is also very courteous and professional."

Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird. The chicken fried rice was not that great too .

Veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. There was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. Taste was on another level.. Biryani was spicy.. A little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. But rest of the items compensated for this..

I highly recommend this place.. Will definitely visit again and again.. 😄

The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children.

Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place."

3, 4, "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings❤️😍
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ❤️
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ❤️❤️ A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. 😍 The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

3, 2, "Been to this place with my friends today, Let me start with the good part first, ordered "Bamboo chicken" as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge.

As part of main course we ordered "Rayala vari kodi pulao" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped "Raju gari kodi pulao", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.

In short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.
Bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing (INR 435) is high for the quantity we get."

Starters we're decent but main course was horrible.
Will not suggest this place."

not at all a nice experience

Not willing to visit again..( would give 2.5 if had a choice)"

1, 2, "Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the "Signature" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."
3, 4, "Visited the clubbing section of the resturant must say ambience is too Good. Visited for ladies and bollywood night and one of the most nice DJs i could say.. Coming to drinks and they lived upto expectations.. we order Chinken Nazakat and butter garlic prawns and they were exotic and tasty...Finding these two too good went ahead with Fish Finger and kalmi Kabab.. They were good too...to scale up i would say must visit it to enjoy it."
1, 2, "I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together."
3, 4, "The best place for having authentic north indian food. Amritsari kulcha with chole, butter naan with dal makhani..you won't find it better than here. The galouti kebabs were too yummy and had the typical 'melt in mouth' functionality."

Good seating. Especially outside.

The breakfast buffet is very good. Really appreciated the chef's professional and dedication. As I was staying in the hotel hence throughout the week, my experience with the staff and food was excellent.
The brew was good too."
3, 4, "Nice restaurant for buffet with family and friends. There are enough options to fill your tummy with a decent price. I had been here for 4 times with friends as well as family. All the starters and main course are good in taste and quality, chicken biryani is one of the best made which I prefer to eat at least a cup only in this restaurant for buffet. You have enough deserts and salads to choose. A welcome drink which is very less in quantity but it worth to eat more 😊"

0, 1, "Did not enjoy our evening at all. Just realised not to order Sushi if it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant. Nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice.. I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience."

1, 0, "I would have rated a big 0 or -1 here if I can. its team lunch outing with 40 members. I'm reviewing this keeping in mind that we paid 1500 per person
Food :
there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice.
Starters : cold, not fresh, tasteless and very hard to eat. VEG: potato, Baby corn. Non-Veg : chicken, Fish
not even a smell of Prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu.
main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel
Ambience : only tables and chairs are provided. no clothes or spoons or tissues on the table. just like a road side dhaba.
Service : too slow and no up to the expectations"

2, 1, "Delivery Review :

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."

3, 2, "This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time. The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final. The live dj was great. Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed 🍺 (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table."
3, 2, "Catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance. As this place is mainly a bar, it is not sensible to comment on the food. The spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good. Pricing is also decent."

3, 2, "Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. Following summaries my experience below-:

Ambiance- The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin. The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai. Ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5

Service- You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. It is an entirely self service type of mode. Nothing extraordinary. 3/5

Food- We tried the following two doughnuts-:

Kit kat doughnut- The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. The chocolate factor was also less. The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.

Mango doughnut- Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. Just for that 3/5.

Will I come here again? I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry. Do try that if you like strawberries."

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste."

If you are bored of the usuals like McDonald’s and Burger King, do try the burgers at Dunkin Donuts and give the titular donuts a complete pass; they are dry and the toppings too sweet. I always remember the burgers from Dunkin Donuts as crisp, tasty and juicy and that’s exactly how the Big Joy Veg Burger was when I tried it last weekend. Truly a Big Joy!"
3, 4, "This place was in my bucket list for quite some time. Visited there last week with my colleagues. This is the best lively pub I have been to in Hyderabad.

I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with."

Must try items here are alu kucha ,chole bahturae ,alu onion paratha and sweet lassi.

This place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here who,this place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad.

Giving 5 start only for food,do no expect any kind of ambiance , visit this place only if you eat punjabi food."

Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!"

A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice. It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours. I absolutely loved it.
Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu. I did not find anything very special in it. Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there."

# Electrifying Dance Floor

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

Ambience-4/5"
3, 4, "Starters:
🍴Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
🍴Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
🍽️ Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
🍽️ Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
🍹Summer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
🍹Fresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"

Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."

Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."
4, 3, "Been there for a team lunch.. Ordered Ulvacharu mutton biryani, Chicken pulao and Bamboo chicken
Ulvacharu mutton biryani (5stars) was the winner.. everyone in the team absolutely loved it.
Bamboo chicken (3 Stars) Although it was cooked in a Bamboo, it wasn't hot and the bamboo looked like it was already used earlier.. after complaining to the manager they served it again and then it was hot and nice.
Chicken pulao was good.
Staff is very polite!
Over all a good experience! Definitely 3.5 Stars and above"

1, 0, "So we have been here last week,
Ambience was ok types, not so appealing. Crockery used for service was good.
Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can’t eat.
Steam rice was salty too.
Frankly speak, we did not like food except reshami kabab. Rest of food was pathetic."
4, 3, "Small outlet with amazing and tasty food. Every dish here has always been great. My personal recommendation is being hungry special biryani, lemon chicken, chicken tikka ,chicken lollipop. Pocket friendly."
2, 1, "The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. 
Neways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.

Taste: 3
Service: 2
Ambience: 2
Value For Money: 2"
3, 2, "Food and ambiance are great here, but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity. Service was too slow and can't able to manage things.

We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao, chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao, names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste.  

Overall review: Raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao."

2, 1, "Super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype. We ordered:
▪Mint mocha - which tasted OK
▪Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
▪Mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
▪coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
▪vegetarian cafe
▪good location
▪good music
▪they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low. There's so much competition out there, you have to rev-up your game.
Serve good food and bring your reputation up. Challenge accepted?"

They say 2+2 drinks but when you order cocktails they say it won’t be applicable as they use 60 Ml

The dahi papri was sweet n tangy,, bhelpuri was well balanced with spices and lot of shev and finally aloo tikki with dhaniya chutyney was tangy and spicy in a balanced way .With well balanced spices and awesome taste this place stole my heart.

Bhindi masala was more like a thick curry, but could eat it somehow.

The noodles were totally tasteless and we had to add spices to make it taste better. Worst of all it had no salt.

Visited this place for dinner yesterday night. I would say first visit was very nice. Pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied . We ordered Mezze platter and Frio Signature Chicken Wings for starters. Mezze platter was very flavourful and good in quantity. Chicken wings were also very delicious . The Barbecue one was my favourite. For the mains we ordered Barbecue Pork Ribs and Greek Chicken Souvlaki. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. Really liked the flavour of the Chicken Souvlaki.
Staff is courteous and friendly. Good experience all together."

2, 1, "After hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a Sunday.
Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

Used Zomato Gold here."

To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."

Sad to say...the most overpriced and shittiest food I have ever tasted in Hyderabad..
One star for the beer and masala peanuts....

On top of that they tried to scam us by charging a whopping service charge..."
