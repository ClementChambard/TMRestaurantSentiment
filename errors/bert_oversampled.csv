2, 3, "Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us 😄 We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!"

Milkshakes and thick coffee was horrible.
AC want working and tables were very dirty.
Wouldn't recommend anyone to visit.."
3, 4, "Been here for my college farewell on a tuesday afternoon! Absolutely loved the ambience. In Food , starters were amazing . However, main course and desserts could be better. We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,
Ambience - 5/5
Dj-5/5
Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Will recommend for partys with friends!!"

2, 3, "if the pongal is made tastier then it would be more better and will have the good ratings as well"
2, 3, "packing was nice. food was good. but pineapple was ripped perfectly as well as it was not fresh. another thing is I ordered for juice pack and u sent me water bottle."
4, 3, "Visited Hyderabadi Daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. Surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. Wondered why we have not visited this place before. A definite must visit from me. Keep it up team HD. You rock!!!!"

This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying.."
1, 2, "curd rice not good"
4, 3, "One of the best places to get your bakery and dessert requirements fixed!
They have been so goood with what they do they have become a household name to reckon with.
Rainbow pastry and fruit biscuits are the one to die for!
Keep the flag high!"
4, 3, "The food is really good and waiter Narender is very enthusiastic with his work. Ambience is just ok and starters are awesome. Main course is just ok and deserts are available with different varieties. 5star rating for Narendra for his work and service."
3, 2, "Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The décor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."

Disappointed."

Beet part, they allows stack on weekend s."
3, 4, "I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could’ve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you’ll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!"
2, 1, "rotis not baked well"
0, 1, "I had a real craving for a chocolate and ordered Death by Chocolate cake and Quadruple Swiss Chocolate Cookie.
Cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend trying(though it's pretty small) . Death by Chocolate cake was not fresh, and had that sugary texture to it. It was really disappointing."
1, 3, "Grilled chicken is not good"
1, 0, "Nasi Goreng, Kung pao chicken & burnt garlic chicken were really spicy & over powered with chilly flakes! Looked & tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it! The saving grace was the Indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice. Really upset with tonight’s order."
4, 3, "The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? 😃

Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.

Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.

Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!"
2, 1, "A small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. At first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for Chinese food in gachibowli. Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen."
2, 3, "Tasty food. However wrong chutney was sent"
4, 3, "The best part about this place is ambiance and seating arrangement, very unique in style and an enjoyable experience especially when visited with friends/family.
We have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa.

People go here to have mandi, the dish that they are meant for. We too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters, chicken tikka and chicken wings, of which the former was palatable.
We had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food. Five of us were unable to finish it off, rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated.
The feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing.
Their service deserves a special mention, they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise.
Overall this is a must visit to have mandi."
1, 2, "This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
3, 4, "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
2, 3, "We ordered from here via swiggy:

We ordered:

Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.

Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.

Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etc
Although we were disappointed that there was no Mushroom."
3, 4, "Went there two times and ordered one same dish i.e. Grilled fish with rice and I must say it's flawless...it should be there signature dish.
Other dishes were tasty too. Liked their service...well trained staff. Overall a good place to enjoy."
3, 4, "A decent restaurant with courteous staff and mouth watering Chinese dishes.A good place to go by for Chinese cuisine...sizzler noodles and bamboo rice is a must try for if you can go with less spice!"
3, 4, "Am big fan of KS as we are regular customers .we know each and every item and here. They'll take feedback too. And service is slow as crowd was big.. But overall good."
0, 2, "New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."
3, 2, "This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."
4, 3, "I tried the buffet dinner. Very good spread both for vegetarians and non vegetarians . The food was good and the staff were friendly too. Will definitely be going there again. Do check out my blog page for more reviews @s.t.a.s.h on instagram."

1, 0, "Ordered veg cheese Maggi. Could never expect a simple dish as Maggi to be bland, over-cooked and tasteless. Better to cook at home than order."
0, 2, "Confused waiters.... half order .... items not available.... customization not available... ahhh total chaos.... but surely not truly Chinese... it's more northeast... nepali food as they are more on spicy and oily side. May be I should have tried thupka or some other northeast specialities.
Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed"
0, 1, "Serving not upto the basic standards. Place smells wierd and costs not at all fair. Not a preferred place for vegetarians. Most of the items on the menu not available"
3, 4, "One definitely have to try their coconut bun and cream cheese bagels. Bread loafs are so fresh here, and we can get variety of cheese. Super place to hangout."
2, 0, "The ambiance of this place doesn’t justify the price. Severely over priced. Only with Gold is it ok. Would prefer if they thought of their service and ambience and try and compare with other restaurants out there."
3, 4, "This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!"
2, 1, "Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid."
4, 3, "Spent an amazing Saturday night there.
Great service.
Ambience is really good.
And Food is okayish but the vibe makes up for it.
Would definitely recommend"
3, 4, "We ordered a cake for my Niece birthday.

Loved the Coco Vanilla cake. This place is so classy/ The guy on tills is very decent and friendly. Will surely come back."
3, 4, "Good and yummy food. We ordered Murgh Dhaniya shorba soup which was so delicious followed with Lal Mirchi teeka tikka which was tender and juicy. Mutton Tawa Biryani is no less compared to others. Will visit again."
1, 2, "The only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me. Sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings. Coz the dish looks pretty but..... Similarly, the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich. But at the end wasn't satisfying."
3, 2, "Date : 14-Feb-2018 @9.30 AM 

Was staying at this hotel so had breakfast at this diner. A decent place , usual breakfast buffet that you find in such a place. The service is good but food and ambience is average. The good part is that the place is spacious."
4, 3, "Went here on last friday. I didn't knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went. Food here was Awesome. I had ordered for Dahi Kebab and it was outstanding. The food presentation and quality and taste all were good ... Would certainly love to visit this place again...!!! Hope they keep continuing their good work."
3, 4, "Good ambience.. Great food.. Well I would say best Parathas out there in the area. Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need."
0, 1, "Food is really very disappointing. Kheema pulao had many chicken pieces and rice was cooked very bad. Even kheema was not prepared well.awful experience"
2, 1, "Heyy veggies!! Good ambience!!
Food I should say is not so appealing...very tough to recommend or think of any standout...Butter Roti is good in breads
Service is good I should say...
Let's talk about Don't Trys:
Manchow Soup
Mushroom Starters (as a mushroom fan..disappointment)
This place would be in my choices with hangouts as priority and not food"
2, 1, "Food is not that much tasty and moreover limited items,limited deserts ,its ok for one time lunch/dinner enjoyed in playing hand football..."
2, 3, "ok"
3, 4, "We have gone for office party
Food was excellent
Service was also good
They have options for rooftop party
We have chosen AC hall it had 45 people capacity
Overall good experience"
0, 1, "Absolutely overhyped place. Substandard biryani and kababs, totally dry and tasteless. No dress code for waiters, hardly any waiters anyway. Pathetic service. I guess each and every place in Hyderabad, which is being talked about, be it pista house or paradise, are totally over hyped."
4, 3, "good"
4, 3, "Goa in Hyderabad!! These guys have cracked this juggernaut .

Ambience - 9/10
Service - 10/10
Food & Drinks - 9/10
Value for Money - 8/10

If you love Goa , this is the place to be in Hyderabad. No wonder they were packed on a weekday ( Wednesday)"
3, 4, "Went there on a Friday, we were only stags but we went there early, at about 6pm. The environment was very energetic, we had great conversations until night and then went to the dance floor. The DJ was amazing, a good mix of English and Hindi songs. Had one of my best night outs here! It was a little on the expensive side though, for 3 people the bill was 9k rs."
2, 0, "Yesterday, as always I went out for family dinner. We wanted to try something new. My wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on Google. As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good. 
Very disappointing experience from Sheraton. I have to think about my relation with Sheraton in the future."
3, 2, "I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don’t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items."
3, 4, "Best paratha you can get in Hyderabad in Gachibowli !! It’s little expensive but 10/10 for food for value !!

Note : Don’t eat paratha if you are on diet !! 😅"
3, 2, "This place is located opposite to Deloitte towers, with the limited seating you will find it mostly over crowded. The ambiance has a vintage feel as soon as you enter.
I ordered Paneer chilli pizza, peach iced tea,chilly cheese tpast and pink sauce pasta...all of them were okayish.
Pizza was perfect indian pizza, tasted like panner chilly gravy on pizza base and pasta also had a very Desi taste to it, they put carrots in pasta which didn't go well at all.I only like the chilly cheese toast which were toasted to perfection.

Price-3/5
Food-3/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-3/5"
4, 3, "I was waiting since long to visit this place. One fine breezy evening I’ve been here for dinner. Great spacious and open space to sit and chill for long. I can say great ambience to sit and relax near to outer ring road. Space is great, customer service was too good, food is delicious. Must try sea food space for fish ...
Food :4.5
Service : amazing
Hygiene : 4
VFM : 4
Worth visiting once more: Yes"
1, 2, "the quality is coming down!!! the waffles were my fav and now just disappointed"
0, 1, "It was a bad experience. Worst part was when we entered the places and there was this pathetic smell to welcome us. Another issue, you can't just order anything from the menu because maximum number of items were not available.

The food was smelling too.

I ordered "Steam Naga Fish".

If u really want to eat, get a mask(suggestion)."
2, 3, "They sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good. The must try items are brownies, chocochip cookies, banana bread, sandwiches, pizza etc. They sever few items which don’t really have any purpose but just to attract kids(eg: Nutella Brioche), these kind of items might dissatisfy people."
4, 3, "This place is a play of light and shadow... Beautifully organized and carefully decorated with cushions and low height sitting areas.
We had lunch buffet and it was really nice.
Welcome: 1 good-looking and thirst-releiving welcome drink with veg or non-veg soup.
Starters: 3 veg dishes - veg tikki, babycorn and hariyali paneer tikka. 3 non-veg dishes - fish plates, chicken wings and chicken kebabs.
Main Course: It had wide spread of 5-6 types of salads, 2 types of papad, Veg biriyani, Bisimille bhaat, Bhindi fry, Mix veg, Paneer butter masala, Veg Manchurian, Veg noodles, Curd rice, Chicken Fried rice, Chicken biriyani, mutton handi, chicken shakahari and fish gravy.

3, 4, "My friend ordered the Ulavacharu Chicken Bone Pulao from T-Grill. The price was high, but the taste justified it. It is one of the spicier foods I tried in Hyderabad. I always though Hyderabadi food was spicy. But, I never came across anything very spicy. This one was spicy enough to be memorable. It's one of the best pulaos I've ever had. You will definitely love it."
3, 4, "Ordered Meals(Dal makhni + Rice + roti + Aloo Gobhi). Tastes really good and was fulfilling too. Just one thing, if you could include some plastic cutlery, So that we can pour curries into the bowls. It is difficult to manage this in office without cutlery."
3, 4, "Went to this place for lunch. Opted for a Set Menu with the on going Dim Sun Festival. Soup was good. Dim sums were awesome and they served a wide variety of Bao, Gyoza, Dim Sum, Wonton.

Loved the place, it was spacious and the ambiance was really good. The first thing I ordered was coffee but they were not serving any hot beverages. Next wanted to try pizza as they serve in different shapes but that too was unavailable. Did not felt like ordering anything after this. Highly disappointed."

Well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter, this one is comfort at its best.

I ordered a Coffee Latey Shake [Rs.169] and my friend ordered a Coffee Caramelo Shake [Rs.169]. Both the shakes were really nice and thick. They are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.

On my second visit to this place I tried it's Go Guava Shake [Rs.145] and it is my favorite. It tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with Guava crush.

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."

Cimmincated to zomato paid 20 credits but don't know what was it about."
3, 4, "By far, one of the best restaurant for North Indian Cuisine. It is our go to outlet for ordering food. The Thalis are really fabulous(Both veg and non-veg) . The quantity is more than sufficient for one person and quality has been really consistent!
They also offer Lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal Hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (A typical awadhi pulaao). Overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your North Indian taste buds!"

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla."

Milky way had shredded chicken combined with creamy mayo and a cheese slice. This is a must have for anyone with a craving for cheesy and creamy burgers.. Thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice.. The burger just melts in your mouth.. Must visit place for bbq lovers.."

Recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha. They serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni.

A quaint little place opposite SLN Terminus, this joint serves authentic Tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover's delight. We had ordered Minty Cucumber in mocktails, a Korean appetizer Tangsuyuk, Kalbi Bokum, Smoked Pork fried with Bamboo Shoots and Teriyaki Chicken. All the dishes tasted good, the Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet though.
Would love to visit again and try out their other delicacies."

It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.
I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake."

1, 0, "I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don’t think I would go back there again."

Ambiance- 3.5/5
It has a black theme with modern crafty ceilings & is dimly lit but not dark. One of the pleasant ambiance around that area, best for evenings with friends/ colleagues. The seating was not very comfortable. They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!
Overall the food was good but can be improved.

3, 2, "Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.
My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes."

They have 'Drunch' on Saturday and Sunday , it's like unlimited drinks and starters. Also on weekdays they have karaoke and live music. One of the good party place in gacchibowli. They even have outside seating area.

Overall a perfect party place!!!"
3, 2, "This one is near to paradise gachibowli. The ambience is decent and the service is fine. We tried the pepper chicken for starters and then for main course, we tried kolhapuri paneer with butter naan and tandoori roti. Pepper chicken but the quantity was too less for their price. Either the quantity or price could be changed. Main course was fine, especially butter naan was really nice."

Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers."

It was not as expected. Did not taste quite well. The parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark. The kheer was not sweet enough. Not a big fan of their Navratri box.
I was disappointed with the food, though the food came in nice packaging. Very neatly packed but taste was not so neat.
Need to improve a lot."

Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup."

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so, it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience.

the food was good, service was ok (surprisingly!!!), price is also okish
(a bit pricey u can say)
rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

anyways, they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration, so that was nice."

The taste of the rice was more sour than expected and was difficult to complete it. The package was not taped and the ketchup was missing for which I have paid. Highly disappointed with the service."

The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.
We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.
Thoroughly disappointing.
Ambience is the only saving grace for this place.

Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

Low crowd made us feel even more comfortable.
Attractive and romantic ambience..
Tasty food and very much reasonable...
Good service..
I had chicken breast steaks with mashed potatoes and salad 😋 unexpectedly so good taste.
If you are a pasta lover, then do order white sauce pasta.
It tasted incredibly hot and yummy.
As we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
We wrapped up having sea salt Nutella dessert which was heaven of Nutella and different taste.
In recent times I've never been to such a good place with decent crowd and tastyyyy food.
I agree that prices are high but I forgot about the price when I had one spoon of food.

Do visit this place with your loved ones I bet you will have a perfect date."

4, 3, "T-Grill is on the main road next to ICICI campus in the Financial Dist, spread over an acre it has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is midst of neatly done green lawns with small and large hut shaped structures.

We started with Grilled fish that was Basa/Cod fillet skewered upon coals; it was spicy and tasted well with green dahi chutney. The Paya shorba/soup was extremely spicy but very tasty.  Then we had Kottimira Chicken, Mutton Dalcha with Bagara Rice for the main course that came as a recommendation. Pachipulusu with the Bagara Rice also tasted awesome. On the whole, all the dishes we tasted there were awesome except for the heat from the spice!

Authentic Telangana and Andhra Signature dishes! Will definitely try again for the rest of the menu recommendations!"

Must try place though a little high on pocket.
And the service is also good. Loved it😊"

The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes."

I really wish they would serve pancakes too and most importantly have labels for dishes which are to be made to order. You must try their range of English desserts, croissants, donuts and biscuits. They also have an array of unique jams which would melt your heart with the soft bread. Overall a delightful experience.

0, 2, "I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again."

Staff is a bit clueless (lazy service). Overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes. Nothing great or distinctive. This review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time."

Ambience : 1star: the place doesn't not have exhaust or ventilation and has only 2 ACs which seemed to not work. it's connected to the kitchen so was smelling of the meat. No music. We were asked to occupy a table which had used plates still kept.
Service: 1 star. The staff didn't seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us.
Not to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktails(we already read about their slow service so was expecting it)
Non veg food: momos were very average like that of zomos may be.
Veg: the ramyum noodles were literally veg Maggi! Very misleading name and price.
Veg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice."

We ordered nachos which was a big disappointment because either they were not baked properly or they were old they tasted weird.

People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again"

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

The ambience is good but the service, quality and quantity of food is amazing. We had soup which was good and as a part of starters we had ginger chicken which was really amazing.
For main course we had hakka noodles with chicken in spicy black bean sauce and mongolian chicken. I must say all of them were really amazing and had a great quantity and quality is beyond words.
Then in desert we had chocolate mousse and chocolate volcano with vanilla ice cream.
Mousse was good but the volcano was really really good.
I would say a must place to go if you are looking for good chinese food and are bored with Mainland China 😂😂"

It's a place with the theme old is gold, so you can see pictures from the past hanging on the walls.
All of you can try out this place as it's located very near to IT offices.

1, 2, "#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."
3, 2, "Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"
3, 4, "This restaurant was too good in serving food - both quantity and quality wise. All the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity. Ambience was good. We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)"

Not at all worth, checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed."

Eat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.

When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.

Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.

In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.

After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill."

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit

Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."

The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.

4, 3, "Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.
 Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area."

3, 4, "The largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in Hyderabad. I was surprised by the choices on offer. Spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast.
- cereals, breads, pastries
- eggs, grilled vegetables, breakfast smoothies, sausages
-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema
- cheese and cold cuts
- fresh fruits
I have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.

Service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. I won’t hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it!"
0, 3, "Over all good experience but

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

Pros: Price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing. The way DJ plays music is awesome, He makes even non-dancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing"

From burgers to rice bowls and Noodle bowls too, they've got it all. But once in a while we like to sit back over the amazing Orange Frioska that they whip up and the Mangalore Fried Chicken. Deli9 bistro has some amazing cakes, Burgers and a whole lot of varities to choose from the Menu. A Must Visit place although there is a confusion of choice I clearly declare this as a winner for me. 4/5 is my liking"

Must try: chilli cheese toast and donuts
Choco almond bomb for sweet tooth is a must try"
1, 2, "The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of "FRESH" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."

As it's ramzan season they also served haleem which is not good in taste..disappointed for haleem..
Coming to starters kubani ka meeta and semiya was good..overall a nice experience!!😊"

Starters were really good specially chicken tikka periperi and main course was good but too oily, biryani disappointed us as there is no masala flavor just topped with paneer tikka pieces. Over all it was Just okay they need to improve on service also as I did not find staff so friendly.

Coming to English bf they have provided fruit bread ,wheat bread and also milk bread and you can toast them also.They gave 2 variety of cakes one pastry and other cup cake. They have also given roasted tomato along with mynassie.One more is crossient and watermelon juice and fruits.

We had gone for Ritviz's show which was a super duper hit. They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well). The ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any."

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

Pretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!"

3, 4, "Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."

My biggest surprise with vada and Bamboo chicken biryani. Vada with chicken curry, bamboo chicken biryani with chicken gravy made my day. Wide variety of desserts are to a special mention. Hotel management is very friendly and helped to make our experience much better. Most recommended place if you are a lover of buffets."

I don't think they understand the ingredients of the type of coffee that you order.coz I had asked for a strong cappuccino and what was offered was more on the terms of a milky latte.

The food, well I had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayish.I don't know how the keema pav tasted though.

All in all, this place isn't that great when you compare with other cafes in the town."

The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don’t like sweet dishes. May be it’s the authentic Orange Chicken)
All together good experience. Staff is also very courteous and professional."

We ordered schezwan chicken and corn palak roll for starters.. The Corn rolls were soo fresh.. It tasted amazing.. Chicken was spicy and nice too..

Veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. There was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. Taste was on another level.. Biryani was spicy.. A little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. But rest of the items compensated for this..

I highly recommend this place.. Will definitely visit again and again.. 😄

The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!"

Stay healthy. Keep eating..not from here.

1, 0, "We booked for 40 people for an office party and it was a complete chaos. Some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant, so the expectations were little high but a complete let down. Firstly, they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people. Some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and I arrived 10 mins late, and simply didn't get it. For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served. What a big mess it was. The complete team of 40 was disappointed."

Then got lunch after an hour. I guess they forget orders after you give them, you have to remind them atleast twice or thrice to get it."

Thank you ."
3, 4, "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings❤️😍
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ❤️
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ❤️❤️ A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. 😍 The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

Taste wise : 4.5/5
Price: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Allover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)"
1, 2, "When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food.

1, 2, "Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the "Signature" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."

They were good too...to scale up i would say must visit it to enjoy it."

All the starters and main course are good in taste and quality, chicken biryani is one of the best made which I prefer to eat at least a cup only in this restaurant for buffet. You have enough deserts and salads to choose. A welcome drink which is very less in quantity but it worth to eat more 😊"

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."

Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed 🍺 (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table."

According to the description there was supposed to be perk and kitkat and hot chocolate fudge in it but there was nothing of it. It was a normal choco chips ice-cream which I could have got for 80Rs instead I paid 180Rs for it. My suggestion just order basic ice-creams from amul don't go for anything else which is costly. And when the delivery boy delivered the ice-cream it was melting. Disappointed by the service of the outlet."

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste."

3, 2, "Some bad donuts and some surprisingly good burgers! That pretty much sums up my experience with Dunkin Donuts. If you are bored of the usuals like McDonald’s and Burger King, do try the burgers at Dunkin Donuts and give the titular donuts a complete pass; they are dry and the toppings too sweet. I always remember the burgers from Dunkin Donuts as crisp, tasty and juicy and that’s exactly how the Big Joy Veg Burger was when I tried it last weekend. Truly a Big Joy!"
3, 2, "Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke?

I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with."

Must try items here are alu kucha ,chole bahturae ,alu onion paratha and sweet lassi.

This place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here who,this place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad.

Giving 5 start only for food,do no expect any kind of ambiance , visit this place only if you eat punjabi food."

The place is not bad, easy to find, valet and comfortable seating. Service was decent as well.

Food was outrageous, the order was chicken corn & manchow soups which were ok, Prawns and teriyaki chicken which were decent but the killer was Pan Fried noodles, if you cant make it the way it is supposed to be then why keep it in the menu??

Vegetables - Baby corn, Brocolli appeared stale and they got a WIERD mushroom, which was yuckyyy to the core. I eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible.

Stay away from Pan fried!!!!"

4, 3, "I was invited by Mr. Srinivas, the man in charge at AWW for a tasting lunch session, the food was complimentary from their side. I had a nice afternoon there. The restaurant is very well placed in Gachibowli, just near Karachi Bakery on Old Mumbai Highway.

The best part of the experience (beside the wonderful time spent with Mr. Srinivas) was the food. I tasted their chicken nuggets, caesar salad, different types of chicken wings and I took a parcel of grilled chicken burger with fries.
- I really encourage everyone to try their wings! I had texas bbq sauce, parmesan and garlic, mexican and lemon pepper sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed every style. The wings were juicy and tender, yammm.
- Caesar salad was very nicely dressed, nice chunks of chicken there and the croutons made the dish complete.
- The burger was definitely above the average burgers you have in the city. The burger patty was a real burger patty not some sweet bun.
- Nuggets were regular, deep fried with mayo, nothing special here, just a decent starter.
More of that, I checked their menu and the prices are really reasonable!

Aside the good food, there is some room for improvement. The place should be better maintained. At the entrance door there was a bit of mess and the cleanliness is not their strongest point. The order and cash counter side looks more like a storage area with boxes and bags over there. The tables, floors and windows should be spotless because this restaurant really has potential! And also I would suggest to have a better quality cutlery because the plastic fork given was horrible, it bended every each time I tried to pick some food. If they will focus a bit more on maintenance and details it can be a busy place because definitely the food is good.

Overall a reasonable priced restaurant with good food and some room for improvement in the ambiance area. But definitely recommended for a least a try!

The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."

1, 2, "Dissatisfaction and Disappointment!

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei " huddi" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.
Like 50% of an all."

4, 3, "good"
4, 3, "I like the theme over here, in which they used tires as chairs. The concept is very cool with all varieties of bikes.

A place to hangout and can have a very good coffee and hot chocolate. Oh my god! The hot chocolate is just yum in tummy.

They have a very good cars and bikes which will be given for rent.

It is definitely a very good hangout place with nice music and very good ambience."

We went for the buffet here and I can't tell one dish that wasn't even average. Everything was very good. Coming back soon."

2, 4, "could have better packaging and combo options in the menu"

4, 3, "Ambience - 5/5
Food - 4/5
Food was just awesome. Best part was we asked for a curry outside the menu and was well served with that.
Service - 5/5
It was wonderful. Love the politeness of the staff.
Value for Money - 5/5
With all the taste, ambience and service it is totally worth eating.

Only thing I would complain about was staff need more clarity on Zomato gold as I was being given wrong bill and it took me sometime to make them understand that there way of deduction does not comply with T&C given by Zomato, hope that is taken care so as no other customer face the inconvenience."
4, 3, "This is an amazing place serving authentic Hyderabadi delicacies.
The quantity of the biriyani is amazing and the taste is mouthwatering. The galauti kebab and the seekh kebabs were magnificent. I even brought the biriyani to Calcutta while traveling. Definitely Worth visiting!!"
2, 3, "it's OK, little spicy."
3, 4, "Starters:
🍴Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
🍴Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
🍽️ Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
🍽️ Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
🍹Summer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
🍹Fresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"
3, 0, "Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."

Quantity is good and quality is best.
For pure veggies kaju pulav and paneer pulav are best options and really enjoyable"
3, 4, "A lot of people suggested this place for some real spicy food. Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."
2, 3, "I have visited the place on 3 occasions, twice on weekends and once in weekday. Getting seats on weekends is very difficult. Also, the entry is charged for couple as well as stag, however it is covered in bill.

Pros:
1. Great ambience
2. Very big dance floor
3. Hindi music after 10pm even on week days
4. Food is Fine.

Cons:
1. Uncomfortable sitting, especially if wearing short dresses.
2. On weekends, service is very slow.
3. Drinks are tooooo expensive and can easily cause a dent on pocket."
4, 3, "Been there for a team lunch.. Ordered Ulvacharu mutton biryani, Chicken pulao and Bamboo chicken
Ulvacharu mutton biryani (5stars) was the winner.. everyone in the team absolutely loved it.
Bamboo chicken (3 Stars) Although it was cooked in a Bamboo, it wasn't hot and the bamboo looked like it was already used earlier.. after complaining to the manager they served it again and then it was hot and nice.
Chicken pulao was good.
Staff is very polite!
Over all a good experience! Definitely 3.5 Stars and above"

Ambience was ok types, not so appealing. Crockery used for service was good.
Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can’t eat.
Steam rice was salty too.
Frankly speak, we did not like food except reshami kabab. Rest of food was pathetic."

3, 2, "Food and ambiance are great here, but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity. Service was too slow and can't able to manage things.

We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao, chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao, names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste.  

Overall review: Raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao."

0, 1, "Super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype. We ordered:
▪Mint mocha - which tasted OK
▪Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
▪Mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
▪coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
▪vegetarian cafe
▪good location
▪good music
▪they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low. There's so much competition out there, you have to rev-up your game.
Serve good food and bring your reputation up. Challenge accepted?"

Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging .

Visited this place for dinner yesterday night. I would say first visit was very nice. Pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied . We ordered Mezze platter and Frio Signature Chicken Wings for starters. Mezze platter was very flavourful and good in quantity. Chicken wings were also very delicious . The Barbecue one was my favourite. For the mains we ordered Barbecue Pork Ribs and Greek Chicken Souvlaki. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. Really liked the flavour of the Chicken Souvlaki.

2, 3, "Being close to my house SLN Terminus is one place I have often visited be it Serifina ( that got closed) or the Lal Street or mystery rooms or 10D . It's a happening place and worth a visit.

Have been to 10D quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.

We visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.

Ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.

Service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend

Food - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.

Drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try

Overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
Friday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend. And yes the more the merrier... You are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

Food - 4/5

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

1, 0, "It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."

The typical vegetarian restaurant serves pretty good Thalis. These unlimited Thalis are served at Lunch and dinner. There are wide variety of curries both in the south indian and north indian Thalis. They should have included Puri's in the north indian Thali as well. The expectation is reached as they served this food in a banana leaf.

The ambience of the restaurant is good can't say great but it's good.
