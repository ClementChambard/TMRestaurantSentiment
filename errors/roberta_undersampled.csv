2, 3, "Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us 😄 We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!"

1, 2, "taste was good. but you provided only one mayo packet and 2 chilli sauce for 3 momo orders. and the ones provided dripped onto the package because of loose package"
3, 4, "I absolutely love ordering from this place for all special occasions. I make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever I am visiting my parents.
This place is pretty expensive and there’s no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year, it’s so worth it.
I have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but I have tried their sample cakes multiple times and I can’t wait to order them.
Note: they usually need advance orders so give your order on time and they are closed on Sundays so make sure that you call and confirm before making the trip."
1, 2, "Marsala Food company is an alright place to have a quick lunch if you don’t want to travel far from work. We ordered a mutton biryani and literally had to tug the mutton pieces apart; they were really hard. The food is fine and doesn’t actually reach the fine dining standards the restaurant boats of. The place could use better service and food quality.
Overall, not a bad place to have a meal."

This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying.."
1, 2, "curd rice not good"
4, 3, "One of the best places to get your bakery and dessert requirements fixed!
They have been so goood with what they do they have become a household name to reckon with.
Rainbow pastry and fruit biscuits are the one to die for!
Keep the flag high!"
3, 2, "Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The décor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."
3, 4, "Good food and Great Ambience... Nice place to have Mandi..and this place offers variety of Arabian, Turkish recipes too..Also a great place to take clicks..."

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us."

It’s my favourite place for desserts and birthday cakes

Would definitely recommend everyone to try their ice cream cakes !!"

VFM - 3.5
Packing - 3.5
Service 3.5

Have been to this place multiple times. This is located at the bottom floor of SLN Terminal Mall. Ordered Heaven Can Wait Chicken burger, Double Big Joy and Big Joy Veg burgers.
Heaven Can Wait was awesome with two chicken patties of pepper and spicy flavors, along with lettuce, cheese and jalapeño sauce. Packing for delivery can be improved though.
The big joy buggers were fine but lacking in sauces."

3, 4, "I had a food session here. The service was very nice and food was nice too. They have this two amazing varieties of soups, Arabianchicken soup and lemon coriander soup, which were amazing. Dragon Chicken and Hariyali fish is a must try. Chiken pahadi was good as well. They have two varieties of Mandi, fish fried mandi and chicken grilled Mandi, the presentation was excellent. I’m in love with the chicken Mandi here. They have a variety of milkshakes and deserts. Kaddu ki kheer was delicious . Lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell."

Disappointed."

3, 4, "I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could’ve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you’ll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!"
1, 3, "Grilled chicken is not good"
2, 3, "A nice place to hangout with friends and have drinks.
Must try the brewed beer. I tried the OTM ledger, which was pretty good.

Food wise pizza was pretty good. We ordered the mexican pizza. Along with crispy lotus stem and water chestnuts.

Deducting one star for poor service and lack of staffs which resulted in delay in services."
2, 3, "What I love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!

Tried:

poppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.

old granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.

berry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.
caramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.

coffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
Cheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.
Blueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.

Mint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.

They have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.

Cheers.!!"
3, 4, "it is one of the best in gachibowli. it is value for money. the best item i liked is Veg.Biryani and Sambar Rice. I always love to party there."
2, 3, "Taste is good, but quantity is very less for that price"
3, 4, "One of the best biryani of the this ipl season accidentally order but find one of the best place for starters and wide range of variety of biryanis must try taste 5/5 quality 5/5 overall 5/5 thanks zomato"
2, 1, "A small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. At first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for Chinese food in gachibowli. Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen."
2, 3, "Tasty food. However wrong chutney was sent"
1, 2, "This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
3, 4, "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
3, 4, "Went for the dinner with the family. All the items were delicious. You must try the firni in deserts.
Dont miss the platter and mouth watering non veg platters."
1, 2, "I'm reviewing a delivery order.

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this."
2, 3, "We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

Taste: 3.5/5

2, 3, "We ordered from here via swiggy:

We ordered:

Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.

Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.

Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etc
Although we were disappointed that there was no Mushroom."

1, 2, "New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."
3, 2, "This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."

Death by chocolate donut tasted like chocolate cake and rainbow pop has the right amount of frosting, and the donut itself was very soft. Potato wedges were horrible, the pieces were very big and two of them were not cooked properly!!!!"
3, 4, "It's been a great experience visiting this place. The staff over here ensure that you are served with the best food especially Suraj . When we expressed our concern that the we did not like the grill fish item , they served us fried fish which was not even part of their menu ."
2, 3, "I went to this place for a lunch with my friend. We were the first one to land at the restaurant - sharp @12noon. Yeah! We were actually hungry. I liked the place - decoration was awesome! Cool interior. We ordered Veg Machaow Soup, Masala Papad, butter naan, Paneer Massallam and masala cold drinks. Please do note they give only Masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink. We liked the food, taste was good. But the cold drink was tasteless - I guess it was already opened one so couldn't get the taste bar that everything was good. Ambiance was actually the best - decoration, the and ample space. But service could have been good and fast.

2, 3, "They’ve opened up recently and I think they have a long way to reach good management.
Other than beer, I’ve tried their LIT and a classic martini!
They’ve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar.
Food was delicious.
I’ve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

The only problem I faced was table management.
Each time I had to order, I literally had to shout and wave my hands multiple times to get someone’s attention to my table.

Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy.

Loved it totally.
From now on everyday without lunch box at office would be Squeeze @ The Lime day."
2, 3, "Food: ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes, kafuli, shaam savera and naans, everything was spiced appropriately. Kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet, a tangy taste of tomato gravy.

Service: a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members.

Ambience: it has indoor and outdoor seating both, we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played. Ambience is overall very average.

Value for money: Great. It is actually cheaper than we expected for the quantity and quality of food it served."
1, 0, "Visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. Not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won’t pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn’t noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered “papdi paneer kebab” as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

Highly disappointed."

Food quality and staff slowness made me horrible.
Seems they have done some renovation recently, which give something new and good feeling. But to be honest, in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service. And if this is not maintained then there is no meaning ..!
All the best guys and please do some deep thinking and improve the food quality and service part."

As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good. 
Very disappointing experience from Sheraton. I have to think about my relation with Sheraton in the future."

2, 3, "Want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you’re at it , munch on some delicious food? Karachi Cafe , Gachibowli is THE place for you!
Food:
•Peri peri chicken- This dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,Garlic bread and sautéed vegetables.
The chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.
•Chicken pesto sandwich- The sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. It has very light taste and perfect meal for two on Hot summer day.
•Bun Maska- Literally the best BUNS you could get your hands on! Filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it’s literally addictive!

Beverages:
•Cold coffee- The beverage wasn’t cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. Would not recommend this drink.
•Irani chai- generally Irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn’t very sugary. It had a mild yet tempting taste . Would definitely recommend.

Ambience: Every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty. Perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family."

The only problem is the service is pretty slow which is probably because there isn't enough staff.
Otherwise no complaints at all."

If u really want to eat, get a mask(suggestion)."

1, 2, ""Haleem Haleem Haleem"

Hello Peeps;
People Around Us Say Pista House , Pista House During Ramzan Just Because They Prepare Haleem well.

I Was literally Waiting For A Free Time To Go & Have Haleem .
Then Seeing The Very Big Queue Outside The Pista House I Decided To Go Home & Order.

I Ordered Mutton Haleem , Naan & Paneer Butter Masala.
Naan & Paneer Butter Masala Were Mouth Watering To Look At & Even Tasted Soooo Good!!!

Haleem Wasn't that excellent. It Was Ok Ok Because They Added A Lotss Of Spices Like Black Pepper & Cloves.

👉👉It's Irritating When You Chew Haleem & Get Lots Of Cloves In Between When You Chew ( I hope You Understood, Lol)

Paneer Butter Masala : Quantity Was Sufficient For 5 Naans. I Would Rate 5 For The Taste. But I would Rate this Restaurant Upon Haleem Only.

Haleem Taste : As I Said , Not As Expected. It Was Just Ok. Cloves Spoiled My Cup Of Haleem.

I Will Still Give It A Try In Other Branches Of Pista House & Will Let You Know The Reviews."

You will definitely love it."

3, 4, "Well if atall I am in Gachibowli area in lunch times or dinner times...my mind like a magnet asks me to get into this cozy bistro. Each thin slices of pizza wid toppings of olive oil and chilli flakes is all you need for your mid day motivation.
Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
Zomato gold is always an add on benifit .
Every time I go to this place...I come out happy tummy n happy soul .."

As for the quantities served and the price, wouldn't really be keen on visiting too often."
2, 3, "On a Saturday casual lunch, i was simply floored by the ambiance they have set up. And I couldn't stop looking at the artifacts they have put up. Its like one could just spent hours looking at them and admiring the heritage of India.

I was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
The wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
The dragon prawns were okayish. The sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

Coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
Sanghai fried rice: loved it
Kung pao chicken : delicious
Hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
Shrimp soft noodles: good
Bamboo fried rice: good
Pan fried noodles in Cantonese sauce: a disaster.

For my part I had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

The mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

I loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken. It has stuck on my taste buds.

Taste: 4

3, 4, "What a scrumptious dinner at Shanghai chef 2.

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ❤️❤️❤️

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special."

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."

They also offer Lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal Hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (A typical awadhi pulaao). Overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your North Indian taste buds!"

Thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice.. The burger just melts in your mouth.. Must visit place for bbq lovers.."

Overall a great experience!"

A quaint little place opposite SLN Terminus, this joint serves authentic Tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover's delight. We had ordered Minty Cucumber in mocktails, a Korean appetizer Tangsuyuk, Kalbi Bokum, Smoked Pork fried with Bamboo Shoots and Teriyaki Chicken. All the dishes tasted good, the Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet though.

It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.
I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake."

They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don’t think I would go back there again."

Moreover the chicken was undercooked or old, our stomach felt funny when we reached home."

Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers."

Visited Zing’s Northeast Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I wasn’t disappointed at all. We ordered for :

Roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. The lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

Deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. The pork melted in the mouth. Beautifully prepared 5/5

Steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. A weekend special !! 5/5

Kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

Dotsol Bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. A special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

All downed with non-alcoholic (Coolberg) beer.

Honest food prepared with a lot of passion. Absolute value for money. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations."

2, 3, "Vegetarian Review ~

Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.

We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.

Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

Overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation. Ideal for romantic dates and celebrations. The whole embience is calm and peaceful and makes it best among all @theglassonion"

It was not as expected. Did not taste quite well. The parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark. The kheer was not sweet enough. Not a big fan of their Navratri box.
I was disappointed with the food, though the food came in nice packaging. Very neatly packed but taste was not so neat.
Need to improve a lot."

Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup."

rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

anyways, they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration, so that was nice."

The taste of the rice was more sour than expected and was difficult to complete it. The package was not taped and the ketchup was missing for which I have paid. Highly disappointed with the service."

Prompt delivery. Good quantity and great taste. The bagels are very nicely toasted and had a very generous amount of cream cheese on them.

I unfortunately took my guests to Khaan Saab and learnt a life lesson - never try/experiement new places when you have guests.. 😐🙄

We ordered mutton galauti kebab, mirchi chicken Tikka and paneer tikka for starters.. What place doesn't have mint chutney when you serve kebabs..?! Yes, they dint have mint chutney.. And galauti kebab was so difficult to finish..

Pata soup was no better too.. In main course we ordered Tikka biryani and veg biryani.. And they dint have mirchi ka salan in this.. Tikka biryani was sweet on taste.. It actually tasted like drumstick curry to me.. Such weird analogy but true.. Raita was the only thing I liked of all..

They dint have lassi/soda or milk shakes too.. I dint even bother to click any pics.. What a way to disappoint my guests.. 🙈😅"

The quantity of bhaji was less and taste was just average. That's why I deducted 1 star. But, chole !!! Definitely deserves the rest 4 stars :-)"

Be any cuisine, they do justice to it. Whether it's Chinese, Indian or Italian, everything tastes good. It's a must visit for a Vegetarian food lover.

Must try are Soups and Chinese Starters.

Now the Downside: The buffet here is OK and cheap. Not sure why the quality gets degraded in buffet but same tastes good in Alacarte."

The best part is Desserts. There is so much variety , that you can't have it all and the greed for it will not satisfy.
Must try place though a little high on pocket.
And the service is also good. Loved it😊"

Every crispy item was soggy as if it was out in open for 2-3 days. I want to rate this place with no stars. I will advise everyone in my circle against visiting here for lunch !! Choose any other place."
3, 4, "Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.

Starters were okay ,
I don't understand why there waso muglai / Indian food and not Asian food in an restraunt which specialises in Asian cuisine."

The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes."

Went with my wife today by seeing the 3.9 stars. The place is small and too much crowded. There are very less number of servers compared to footfalls. Now coming to food, ordered chicken drumsticks,but taste was not that great then ordered one non veg sizzler which was also not that great. Noodles in the sizzler were tasteless. Overall did not find the experience which we were expecting."

3, 4, "An amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

Closing line... Best hangout place in Gachibowli area."

The dal makhani was tolerable (but not good). Since it's mango season, expected the mango lassi to be made of fresh ingredients (our fault for not checking). Expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews."

From don't know how long i have been looking for places that serve good momos in hyderabad and found none. Recently ordered from this place and turned out they are just the best momos you can have.

We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good."
3, 4, "Enjoyed a lovely lunch with a friend first time visited the place good food ambience is very nice and a very curtious staff.
Tried the Indian and Chinese items for starters and main course must visit for a good vegetarian meal prices are also pretty reasonable overall 5 star rating for this place."
2, 3, "A fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!

Drinks:

1. Berry blast: Loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. The right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.

2. Green ice mountain mojito: You can find green apples in this drink. A little sour, although i liked it.

I would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.

Teriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. Nothing special about its taste. This is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.

Beef & Pork kimchi bokkum bap: I just liked the flavor of the rice. Both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. They were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. The piece were eatable, and not much chewy.

Pork & Beef Naga chilly curry: The flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. The taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. The gravy is ravishing as well.

Service: Just fine. The waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.

Overall fine dining experience:

Not many on the menu to chose from but they put up what they make the best and live up to it. Could add a little chinese main course on the menu but thats ok. Try the variety of drinks they serve and groove to their lovely choice of music. Enough eye candy for the guys and a fab ladies night for the girls.

Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate."

Service: it was alright. Don't have much to talk about it!"
3, 4, "The service and ambience here is great! Jayanta hasubul atm were very customer obsessed. Starters for both veg and non veg are good. For kids too they provide balloons and a small toy to play with 😃. I definitely recommend this place. The ice cream taste should be improved."

Lasagne is a must try here..
One thing to keep in mind, they will take the last order 5 mins before it closes, and wont give time to eat will just close the lights and ask u to leave."
2, 3, "The dining area is peaceful. Perfect place to have conversations over lunch. Hmm, but if you are too hungry you can totally skip the conversations :P 

Various types of salads are available, if you are a weight watcher or you are a conscious eater :)  I went mad over the Hunan Chicken, it was just amazing. Peri Peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it. 

When I went the spread had a mix of Chinese, Italian, Continental, and South & North Indian food. 

The only thing that disappointed me was the mutton. It was a bit undercooked. It was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel.

Desert, I feel they can do a lot more but I can vouch for the baked yogurt, the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugar-free.

Staff are really cordial and are always with a smile on their face :)"

This restaurant has Eat India Company and Urban Asia merged into one. So u get both North Indian and Asian cuisine menus together. Bit confusing at the start, especially because the waiters don't address this.
Ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce. Like the dish, could have been less spicy though.
Next up was chicken dumpling. This was yummy.
Chicken Thai red curry was good and creamy, but again was a bit spicy for Thai curry. Think the restaurant needs to tone down the spicy quotient of Asian food, otherwise the food was fresh and tasty."
1, 0, "This restaurant has gone way below the acceptable quality levels. Had been a great place to go earlier but looks like they have started compromising in quality of food and service. Items on the menu aren’t available but offered what they had at that time. Rice was watery, none to care for your concern but were commenting on what was wrong and it was eatable. Will never come here again."

They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.
You would find plethora of coffee. It is paradise for a black coffee person.The way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.You are the best,Driven cafe.You have my heart.

People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again"

2, 4, "The place is open seating, gives a good airy feeling. Music is good and it had occupancy on a week day.

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!"
2, 3, "The ambience is quite a steal! Such interiors and those amazing cars and bikes lined up outside 😍 A must visit for bikers cause they even have fancy merchandise inside.

This place being really close to our residence, we are frequent visitors. The best part is that it’s open late in the night hours. You can just have a drink and chill in the outdoor seating area. Pure bliss!

I’ve tried the cafe mocha,mint mocha- strong minty flavour, hot chocolate: all equally good. The snacks are quite average and can be avoided. The chilli cheese toast is a disappointment.

Sizzling brownie was yum and so was pesto pasta though it was slightly overpriced.


One of the cool places to enjoy and try different coffee drinks, I must say. 😇🤘🏽"

3, 4, "Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)
Witte
Beer sampler- (The caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
Dubbel
Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

The food wasn't too oily or spicy. Well flavoured and served warm.

Over all rating- 4.5/5 ( Only because there pricey)
Food- 4/5
Drinks- 4.9/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service- 4.5/5

Would I go back here? Hell yes"

1, 2, "#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."
3, 2, "Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"

3, 4, "This restaurant was too good in serving food - both quantity and quality wise. All the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity. Ambience was good. We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)"

2, 3, "I had been to this place after long time last night for dinner. I must say the ambience is still so marvelous. Each wall has something interesting by itself. A great place for photography. Coming to the food. We ordered:
1. Bull frog
2. Fanta
3. Pepper chicken bao
4. Ginger chicken bao
5. Fish and chips
6. Cajun chicken breast sizzler

The bao's are a must try. Both of them were yummy. Fish and chips were in the same category as well but this time the fish wasn't that great. Coming to the sizzler...i felt chicken was a little hard and the veges needed a pinch of salt. A little bland for my taste. Other than that everything was good."

We were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time. Food was okay not that great taste, the chicken wings were good though. Choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time. Chicken quesadillas didn’t taste like a quesadilla. It was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti. There is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time."

2, 3, "Pros:
Awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen.
Cool ambience.
They always have the best DJs.
Cons:
Too much Vip culture. Almost all the tables are reserved. It's almost impossible to get a table. You are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the VIPs. Even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. Entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. After paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

But hey if you love dancing, there's no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this."
1, 0, "The place is overrated, we went on a Friday afternoon, it was too crowded, had to wait for 15 mins to get a table, once we got the table, order was taken after 15 mins which made it 30 mins of waiting, we had to run behind the waiter to take the order, order was then taken, we had Apollo fish, kung pao chicken and juicy mutton mandi, the fish tasted good, chicken was not cooked properly, coming to mandi, it tasted like we were having boiled mutton with rice, wasn't great at all, and the mandi was around 585rs, I'd rather spend that elsewhere and get 2 mandis for around 600.
Not at all worth, checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed."

Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

Biryani taste is amazing. As I am vegetarian, i usually take Andhra Veg Biryani, Avakaya Biryani or Kaju Biryani. All of them are perfectly made. So all the rating is for only the taste, not for service and ambiance at all."

2, 3, "I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."

3, 4, "Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.

One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.

Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!

We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!

Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!

Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!

Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!

That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!

I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!

Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!"

2, 4, "#Food was #good with right mix of #spices. We went in a group of 6. As soon as we entered they offered #seats and welcomed us. We had two kids with us they gave complimentary #ice #creams for them. It helped us making kids busy while we decided on the menu. Menu had a good #vegetarian variety (we were looking for veg food). We ordered #north #indian #thali, which was yummy. It covered a good mix of curries.

Overall food is good. Just have to be a bit patient as I felt they were slow on service after ordering food (it may be because it had a parallel birthday party going on and was a bit crowded."
3, 4, "I had Al-a-cart menu for lunch, taste is awesum ,service was very appropriate.I had lassuni murg kabab 5/5, ramen 4.5/5,spaghetti aglio olio 4.5/5,pizza 5/5.plus the mushroom dish in live counter was too good.Finally coming on to deserts Chocolate delight 5/5,strawberry mouse 4.6/5,Linzer torte 5/5."

2, 3, "Went here for a team party, the food was top notch and tasted quite different from the usual ones. If you are looking for a change for your taste buds , go for T Grill.
The service can be improved a bit. Otherwise everything is perfect .

P.S.: This place is not for you if you aren’t a fan of spicy food. :p"
1, 2, "I can't say the donuts are too tasty.if you are a sweet lover you can once try this.we ordered a pack of six and I felt no difference in each of these ,in taste they look similar except the yellow one(mango flavoured).

I didn't even feel it as fresh one ,as soon as I ordered he bought the one which he has packed it and kept as stock.overall, I was disappointed for the first time being there.

Once you can try this as a snack, but it's too sweet.
Ambience i can rate as 3.5/5
Food-3/5"

3, 4, "The largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in Hyderabad. I was surprised by the choices on offer. Spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast.
- cereals, breads, pastries
- eggs, grilled vegetables, breakfast smoothies, sausages
-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema
- cheese and cold cuts
- fresh fruits
I have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.

Service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. I won’t hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it!"
2, 3, "Over all good experience but

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

Pros: Price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing. The way DJ plays music is awesome, He makes even non-dancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing"
2, 3, "Rice quantity is less compared to earlier."
1, 2, "Great ambiance with very poor service.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves."

Food is really tasty. The staffs are polite.

1, 2, "Mexican corn parantha was rubbish."
2, 3, "Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).

The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies."

3, 4, "The best place to be if you want to see some sport screening.
What I really liked about the place is they have round about 42 screens and no matter where you sit you will have 5-6 screens which will be clearly visible.
No fight or waiting to get place near to the screen.

We went here during IPL screening.
It was really a great experience.

What we had ordered was ultimate nachos,chicken wings with Chipotle sauce and pizza.

Everything was really delicious.

Portion were quite good for two.

I feel it's bit over priced but worth it..!!

Service is excellent,staff is very warm and friendly.

4.5/5 :)"
3, 2, "Food: 3.5/5
We have ordered
veg manchow soup- it's GOOD
Panner majestic - it was more sour and tangy in taste.
Nijam handi recommended by waiter- it was okay
Panner kulcha - its more salty may be because of butter
Kothimeera butter roti - this one is good and light.

Ambiance:3/5 is alright.
Service :5/5 it was GOOOODD (papu served us)"
1, 2, "The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of "FRESH" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."

As it's ramzan season they also served haleem which is not good in taste..disappointed for haleem..
Coming to starters kubani ka meeta and semiya was good..overall a nice experience!!😊"
3, 4, "Trust it will surely make your innerself more happy. One of the best roof top lounges with such a pleasant ambience, good food and quick service. Nd only complaint is there was no music. They said they have a problem with the socket. But still it's okay. I'll surely visit again"
2, 3, "Ended up this place just before holi and it was a dry day, hardly 2 tables were occupied. Starters were really good specially chicken tikka periperi and main course was good but too oily, biryani disappointed us as there is no masala flavor just topped with paneer tikka pieces. Over all it was Just okay they need to improve on service also as I did not find staff so friendly.

Great experience in beyond flavors."

Before getting there, do you guys remember the small triangle shaped samosa we would all go ga-ga for? Yes. They have it! You don't need to go street to street searching for them. They have it right here. So one plate samosa, irani chai and osmania biscuits. You hit cloud nine! Oh i forgot, this is for you guys! To the guys who are living alone far away from your own home without your mamma and pappa, you'd definitely wanna hit this place listening to 'mere sapno ke rani kab..'. yea. Only Kishore Kumar ! And the place. Let's just say, it's all VINTAGE!
Ambience, food chai, music, cleanliness- 5/5 ❤️"

Coming to English bf they have provided fruit bread ,wheat bread and also milk bread and you can toast them also.They gave 2 variety of cakes one pastry and other cup cake. They have also given roasted tomato along with mynassie.One more is crossient and watermelon juice and fruits.

We had gone for Ritviz's show which was a super duper hit. They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well). The ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any."

2, 3, "This place has freshly baked stuff, probably the best you'd find in this locality but the beverages are just about average!

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

Pretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!"
3, 4, "If you want to try something new from the daily routine taste,try dinning out once in Urban Asia and you will love everything about it.. Give your taste buds a try for the "crispy kai in Bangkok curry" for starter and the cheese balls are mesmerizing .. For main course you definitely try the "bamboo fried rice" and the Malaysian curry combo.. you will love it.... And if your love is for Noodles.. Padh Thai will take your breath away with it's coconut flavoury mouthwatering taste... The soothing music is cherry on the cake. A fine Dinning and Urban Asia is way to go...

S K Allaudin is very good with handling the service and gave all of us an amazing experience."

2, 3, "Nice place very good food but main course should be be improved because starters 4 dessert 4 and main course 3.5 because food in main course was not upto mark need some taste build up"
3, 4, "Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I’d complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush."

Ordered Chicken Peanut Curry & Wok-Tossed Millet Bowl. Gravy tasted good with mix of veggies. Quality of chicken in the gravy is less than normal portion. Millers were kinda dry,overall good experience for me."

2, 3, "Standing true to its 5-star ambience, the food gels to fit in the category of a premium outing. Salads, Chat, North Indian, Continental to South Indian, this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category. There was a huge section of Salads out of which Bacon salad being the pick of the lot. The Starters spread included Hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads, Farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight, Live chat and Pasta counters, Tawa fish, Fish fry, Chicken starters, Pork pepperoni, Sauted mushrooms, Chicken Salami, Bacon, Sausages etc.  

The Main course had Chicken Haleem which was okaish, Chicken Biryani which was good, Mutton curry where I felt the pieces were undercooked, Mirchi ka salan, Veg Biryani and some veg curries. The main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters. Prawns and Crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience. The desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth. They had a humungous spread of sweets which included Chocolate burfi sandwich, mud pudding, motichoor laddu, Barfis, Moong dal Halwa, Phirni, Fruit kheer etc. The pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties. Overall a decent outing experience!"

The food, well I had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayish.I don't know how the keema pav tasted though.

One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite. Amit Agrawal Harsh Jhunjhunwala Poorvi Agarwal"

Although the proportions are quite small, the food is lip smacking good. It is authentic and a delight to my taste buds. The ambience is beautiful with calming elements. This my go-to comfort food restaurant that I would recommend to anyone looking for authentic pan Asian cuisine!"

Very few Veg starters.Can improve in this section"
3, 4, "This luxurious restaurant is located in one of the most posh areas of Hyderabad. Situated on the 10th floor of Sheraton, the extravaganza starts right from its entrance. Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!! Not a highly preferred place, however, you can visit for the experience of high end hospitality!"
1, 2, "Was here with the office team for buffet dinner and drinks and couldn't find much varieties on table. 4 points for taste, 4.5 for service and 2 points for their dismal amount of variety. You don't get much brand choice in drinks either."

3, 2, "Visited with family for dinner on a weekday. Decent place, may be a little more lighting will add to the decor; pretty cozy though. The staff specially Akash needs to be applauded, very enthusiastic and customer focused. The starters were good, very spicy but he got us a fresh set mildly spiced even without we making a request. We were not happy with the main course spread, only 1 curry (chicken n paneer). Good place to hang out with friends for a cocktail and some delicious starters."

Ambiance of cafe is very nice, full of old stuff, photographs and plants as well.
U can also put the plant on your table.
Food is good and quantity is more than enough.

This place became one of my fav. Very frequently I started visiting this place.
I think you people should give a try, will be in love with the plants , stuff, food, ambiance."

I am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness.

3 star is for taste and quality. But quantity doesn't even meet expectations.
Very poor"
2, 4, "Visited this branch of Urban Asia this afternoon for lunch. The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don’t like sweet dishes. May be it’s the authentic Orange Chicken)
All together good experience. Staff is also very courteous and professional."

Good for families who like to spend with their loved ones. and about food I liked cube corn in veg and fish, chicken & prawns in NV. I loved the mutton curry, it was so tender and delicious. And other items were ok. One thing they need to improve is service, though we opted for buffet they were serving starters at table that too with damn slow service and with repeated reminders.

The food was great. We tried veg platter and schezwan noodles.
I liked the beer best. Lots of brews available. Each flavour was different. I loved Barbar and Green Killer IPA.

Service: 10/10

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you’re interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!"

2, 3, "I have been a collage frequent visitor, not to do much with food but I met hy husband for the first time there. So I have tried their brunch many times, and I can finally say that for the cost, their Sunday brunch is good but they need a little more spread and little more taste. Also the staff is sweet but very slow on brunch days since they expect self service on that day."
4, 3, "nice"
3, 4, "found them on Zomato website, a very interesting to say that this restaurant carved a niche in serving juicy  chicken wings with wide spread of 10 to 12 sauces especially Texas BBQ, Spicy garlic too yummy and spicy like Original hot and Amazon wild comes in to top of mind. Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place."

Some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant, so the expectations were little high but a complete let down. Firstly, they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people. Some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and I arrived 10 mins late, and simply didn't get it. For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served. What a big mess it was. The complete team of 40 was disappointed."
1, 0, "Dont get fooled by seeing their advertisements, where they show lavish South Indian thali served on banana leaf. We went there in search of authentic south cusine, but returned disappointed. They didn't have any kind of thali at dinner and serve only north indian ala carte. We ordered some soup and starters which was okay. Then we ordered besibelebhat and curd rice, both were pathetic.They have a very confused theme. Don't waste your time or spoil your mood."

Then got lunch after an hour. I guess they forget orders after you give them, you have to remind them atleast twice or thrice to get it."

3, 4, "Man I unabashedly love Tilt. It's a unique spot amongst all the bars in Hyderabad. What sets it apart is both the beer and the service. Order the egg Manchuria without fail. The cooks are so good at making it now that you won't find a better version anywhere else in town.

The food tends to be on the spicier side, so if you don't want that do remember to tell you waiter during your order if you prefer it otherwise. This even applies to the pastas and pizzas."

Thank you ."

2, 3, "Momos Delight
The chicken kurkure Momo's were a true delight and so were the chicken Momo's which were sprinkled with some special masala. The only downer was the red Momo chutney as it tasted like Tomato sauce. I am sure if they can make authentic Momos,then they can also make authentic Momo's chutney."

3, 4, "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings❤️😍
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ❤️
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ❤️❤️ A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. 😍 The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

Taste wise : 4.5/5
Price: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Allover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)"
1, 2, "When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food. Very disappointed on my next two visits;They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers, seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract."
3, 4, "delivery person is good"
1, 2, "First visit

1. Garlic Fried rice - good
2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup."
2, 3, "Really good place in gachibowli. Ambience is average. But good place with good vibes and crowd. They have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. Open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. They have a dance floor. There are karaoke nights as well. On weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. Entry is from side in the building SLN terminus. lunch menus are bad. Food is just average here. Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun."

Wish there was rating below 1!

1, 2, "Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the "Signature" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."
3, 4, "Visited the clubbing section of the resturant must say ambience is too Good. Visited for ladies and bollywood night and one of the most nice DJs i could say.. Coming to drinks and they lived upto expectations.. we order Chinken Nazakat and butter garlic prawns and they were exotic and tasty...Finding these two too good went ahead with Fish Finger and kalmi Kabab.. They were good too...to scale up i would say must visit it to enjoy it."
1, 2, "I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together."

All the starters and main course are good in taste and quality, chicken biryani is one of the best made which I prefer to eat at least a cup only in this restaurant for buffet. You have enough deserts and salads to choose. A welcome drink which is very less in quantity but it worth to eat more 😊"

I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience."

Food :
there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice.
Starters : cold, not fresh, tasteless and very hard to eat. VEG: potato, Baby corn. Non-Veg : chicken, Fish
not even a smell of Prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu.
main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel
Ambience : only tables and chairs are provided. no clothes or spoons or tissues on the table. just like a road side dhaba.
Service : too slow and no up to the expectations"

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."

Excited to have more ice creams in this hot summer."

When it comes to the food, it was pretty average. I dint feel like i am having a biriyani."

According to the description there was supposed to be perk and kitkat and hot chocolate fudge in it but there was nothing of it. It was a normal choco chips ice-cream which I could have got for 80Rs instead I paid 180Rs for it. My suggestion just order basic ice-creams from amul don't go for anything else which is costly. And when the delivery boy delivered the ice-cream it was melting. Disappointed by the service of the outlet."

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste."

You'll get to experience that personal touch. With every course of meal they take your feedback on how did you like the food, any changes they can make to improve. You can also come here to celebrate your special occasions, they provide cake and also play music for you. We had Mr. Jayanta as our host. He was super humble and served nicely. A big yes for this place!!!"

In phtos, its tandoori roti, lachcha parantha, aloo gobhi ki sabzi and paneer dish"
3, 4, "This place servers the best kuchas and parathas in hyderabad.i have been here many times and this is my first review and i absolutely love the food over here.

Must try items here are alu kucha ,chole bahturae ,alu onion paratha and sweet lassi.

This place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here who,this place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad.

Giving 5 start only for food,do no expect any kind of ambiance , visit this place only if you eat punjabi food."

Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!"

The ambience is amazing..and the food is awesome...

What a talent..
He is a rockstar

Hoping to see him this coming Friday..."

3, 4, "Wonderful restaurant! Absolutely fabulous food!

Ambience: very nice and comfy... Doesn't feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place.

Food: every morsel is heavenly! They nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself... Loved the pizzas, the fish and chips is a must order, the penne Alfredo is pretty good too... As is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish.... Absolutely delicious! Mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... Couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...

P.S. - they do have a bar but no Bira.

Service - polite. But you must be patient. Food preparation takes time. If you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.

VFM - it's an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it. He's absolutely spot on with the flavours. I would strongly recommend this restaurant. You deserve it!"

The malai kebab, patthar ka gosht, tai pei chicken were my personal favorites!
We Also had Butter chicken and butter naan! The taste was just right! Not so spicy at all
Their biryani is famous so no doubt the biryani was exquisite!
Service was on point! And the sweets were too yumm.. The double ka meetha and mango malai are the best among them!
Highly recommend this place! For family and friends!"

When we called the manager, there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty.
The ambience is good though. If only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating.
All we ate that day was curd rice 😑 the entire team.
I wish you guys could improve and we would try here again."

We order something like jaljeera green ... 5*
Lassi salted 5*
Veg Galaouti 5* 6* 10* 100* I just love this

# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb 😒

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."

1, 2, "Dissatisfaction and Disappointment!

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei " huddi" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.
Like 50% of an all."

After finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i’ll try some more. Recommended place if you are a telangana cuisine lover."

The taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts. The next thing that i tried here is the Chocolate overdose. It's a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie. The icecreams are extremely rich and intense. Overall, i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours."
3, 4, "Have visited this place couple of times and as always their service is great and very quick. Specially their staff is very friendly and caring. Their vast buffet menu will give taste of different cuisine. Visited today for my anniversary with my parent. The service by Mr Dharma made it even great experience for them as he served their requested order very swiftly and they enjoyed the evening. Their live counter was something I loved the most. May be adding some options for veg in starter can make it better for veg folks :)"

I don't know why this is happening with this good place.this was unexpected.over all ratting
Food -5/5
Service -2/5
Ambience-4/5"
2, 3, "it's OK, little spicy."
3, 4, "Starters:
🍴Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
🍴Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
🍽️ Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
🍽️ Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
🍹Summer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
🍹Fresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"
2, 0, "Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."

Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."
2, 3, "I have visited the place on 3 occasions, twice on weekends and once in weekday. Getting seats on weekends is very difficult. Also, the entry is charged for couple as well as stag, however it is covered in bill.

Pros:
1. Great ambience
2. Very big dance floor
3. Hindi music after 10pm even on week days
4. Food is Fine.

Cons:
1. Uncomfortable sitting, especially if wearing short dresses.
2. On weekends, service is very slow.

Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can’t eat.
Steam rice was salty too.
Frankly speak, we did not like food except reshami kabab. Rest of food was pathetic."

We ordered Bamboo Chicken and Pachi Mirchi Kodi Pulao. Both the dishes had fresh ingredients.
Bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy. It is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in. It also has dry gravy so it's not entirely a good choice for starters, will go well with any Indian bread.
Pachi Mirchi kodi pulao was awesome. The rice was flavorful. Chicken curry served over it was semi - gravy and yummy as well. The chicken was nicely complementing the rice.
Service can be improved a bit. Will go again to this place to try other dishes."

Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging .

The noodles were totally tasteless and we had to add spices to make it taste better. Worst of all it had no salt.

Not recommended."

The view and the overall ambience was beautiful. The menu of diners pavilion(they have the same kitchen) had enough choices and variety. We ordered basic North Indian and the food was heavenly. Great service and even after levying 10% service charge, the bill was pretty easy on the pocket (having Zomato Gold makes it even better!!) All in all a great place for family lunches and dinners!"

Visited this place for dinner yesterday night. I would say first visit was very nice. Pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied . We ordered Mezze platter and Frio Signature Chicken Wings for starters. Mezze platter was very flavourful and good in quantity. Chicken wings were also very delicious . The Barbecue one was my favourite. For the mains we ordered Barbecue Pork Ribs and Greek Chicken Souvlaki. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. Really liked the flavour of the Chicken Souvlaki.
Staff is courteous and friendly. Good experience all together."

All starters are simply superb.I liked veg munchurian very much.coming to pulao and Biryanies, chicken items are simply superb. But in panner and kaju pulao the masala is very less. I felt like I am eating plain rice. If they would have been added little bit spices it would be great. But after that I have ordered veg munchurian dry many times."

2, 3, "Being close to my house SLN Terminus is one place I have often visited be it Serifina ( that got closed) or the Lal Street or mystery rooms or 10D . It's a happening place and worth a visit.

Have been to 10D quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.

We visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.

Ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.

Service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend

Food - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.

Drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try

Overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
Friday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend. And yes the more the merrier... You are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

I have had better pan fried. However, the best/worst part follows... All of us had to take a sick leave today as we cannot stop going to the washroom. The food quality needs to be definitely checked. We don't expect this from a restaurant of your stature. Never going back and requesting others the same."

Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

Used Zomato Gold here."
1, 0, "It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."

We went with the suggestion of the Steward, for starters had Mushroom on khari, turned out to be a good choice.
Son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket. He was okay.

Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. Turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.

Finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu. A bigger disappointment."
