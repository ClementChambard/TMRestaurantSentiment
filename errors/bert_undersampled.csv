2, 3, "Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!"
2, 3, "Good place. We went to its AC seating area in the cellar. Had butter masala dosa, karampodi idly and Ravva dosa. All were satisfactory . Sambar was bot good but Chutney was good."
2, 3, "Liked the food, the Tom yum soup was okay. The chicken n prawn appetizers were pretty good n tasty. Prawn in oyster sauce was nice. Overall a good experience considering we were a group of 15 with 2 infants ..."
3, 4, "Authenticity...seafood must try. Not spicy, bland and pure Chinese. Schezwan chicken, corn mushroom fried rice, Thukpa, big bowl noodles...yum!"
1, 2, "taste was good. but you provided only one mayo packet and 2 chilli sauce for 3 momo orders. and the ones provided dripped onto the package because of loose package"
1, 2, "Marsala Food company is an alright place to have a quick lunch if you don‚Äôt want to travel far from work. We ordered a mutton biryani and literally had to tug the mutton pieces apart; they were really hard. The food is fine and doesn‚Äôt actually reach the fine dining standards the restaurant boats of. The place could use better service and food quality.
Overall, not a bad place to have a meal."
4, 2, "Loved the food."
3, 4, "Been here for my college farewell on a tuesday afternoon! Absolutely loved the ambience. In Food , starters were amazing . However, main course and desserts could be better. We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,
Ambience - 5/5
Dj-5/5
Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Will recommend for partys with friends!!"
1, 2, "too oily"
2, 3, "Went there on an IPL night. Music and ambience is nice. We ordered drinks and a couple of starters such as stuffed mushroom, chicken in black bean sauce, jalapeno poppers and a fish dish. All the dishes were good but the jalapeno poppers and stuffed mushroom were impressive. The service is slow though and ordering drinks on the app might become a challange at times. Overall a nice place to hangout."
2, 3, "Been here with office colleagues, overall a good place to hangout with a gang. But the sitting arrangements during day time is very tight as people would want to dine inside rather than out in the hot sun.

The food was excellent in taste, The chicken dum biriyani had a very different taste and I loved it."
2, 3, "if the pongal is made tastier then it would be more better and will have the good ratings as well"
1, 3, "packing was nice. food was good. but pineapple was ripped perfectly as well as it was not fresh. another thing is I ordered for juice pack and u sent me water bottle."
4, 3, "Visited Hyderabadi Daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. Surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. Wondered why we have not visited this place before. A definite must visit from me. Keep it up team HD. You rock!!!!"
1, 0, "I have been to this place on a sunday with my friends thinking I can have a good meal and spend time with friends but the moment I arrived there it was around 2:15pm and the manager there started nagging saying that the kitchen is going to close in next 10 minutes can you please place the order. This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying.."
1, 2, "curd rice not good"
4, 3, "One of the best places to get your bakery and dessert requirements fixed!
They have been so goood with what they do they have become a household name to reckon with.
Rainbow pastry and fruit biscuits are the one to die for!
Keep the flag high!"
4, 3, "The food is really good and waiter Narender is very enthusiastic with his work. Ambience is just ok and starters are awesome. Main course is just ok and deserts are available with different varieties. 5star rating for Narendra for his work and service."
3, 2, "Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The d√©cor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."
2, 3, "Strictly vegetarian~~

Late night #needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in DLF for every hungry soul out der but this time I though to order it to my office for my evening hunger. I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5. I haven't tried the Momo's yet, will add to the review once I try them.

I am sure you have already had this sometime, if not you should surely try coz who doesn't like Maggie right!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @hungermaggipoint üòÄ"
2, 3, "Food - 5
VFM - 3.5
Packing - 3.5
Service 3.5

Have been to this place multiple times. This is located at the bottom floor of SLN Terminal Mall. Ordered Heaven Can Wait Chicken burger, Double Big Joy and Big Joy Veg burgers.
Heaven Can Wait was awesome with two chicken patties of pepper and spicy flavors, along with lettuce, cheese and jalape√±o sauce. Packing for delivery can be improved though.
The big joy buggers were fine but lacking in sauces."
1, 0, "I didnt say to include cheese but they did here. .I didnt liked it ."
1, 0, "Pathethic service and bad quality of food. Its hard to give any particular recommendations for this place since neither the ambience, the food or service is good anyway.

Disappointed."
3, 4, "Awesome Ambience, cheap beers and you can get Kingfisher drought tower in rs 750, ,food is also up to the mark.
Beet part, they allows stack on weekend s."
3, 4, "I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could‚Äôve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you‚Äôll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!"
1, 3, "Grilled chicken is not good"
2, 3, "A nice place to hangout with friends and have drinks.
Must try the brewed beer. I tried the OTM ledger, which was pretty good.

Food wise pizza was pretty good. We ordered the mexican pizza. Along with crispy lotus stem and water chestnuts.

Deducting one star for poor service and lack of staffs which resulted in delay in services."
2, 3, "What I love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!

Tried:

poppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.

old granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.

berry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.
caramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.

coffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
Cheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.
Blueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.

Mint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.

They have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.

Cheers.!!"
2, 1, "Been there for lunch few of the non-veg starters were under cooked and mexican chicken was salty and place was too loud with music too.overall didnt had pleasant time"
0, 3, "The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? üòÉ

Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.

Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.

Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!"
2, 3, "Taste is good, but quantity is very less for that price"
0, 3, "Tasty food. However wrong chutney was sent"
4, 3, "The best part about this place is ambiance and seating arrangement, very unique in style and an enjoyable experience especially when visited with friends/family.
We have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa.

People go here to have mandi, the dish that they are meant for. We too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters, chicken tikka and chicken wings, of which the former was palatable.
We had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food. Five of us were unable to finish it off, rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated.
The feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing.
Their service deserves a special mention, they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise.
Overall this is a must visit to have mandi."
1, 2, "Went there on a Sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax - as you do in a cafe. This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels. This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.
Taste - 4 stars
Value For Money - 2 star
Overall - 3 stars"
1, 2, "This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
3, 4, "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
0, 2, "I'm reviewing a delivery order.

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this."
2, 3, "We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

Taste: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5"
2, 3, "I have been ordering from this place for quite some time now. I have tried various types of veg biryanis available. My personal favourites are veg biryani, capsicum and mushroom biryani, mixed veg biryani.
Recently i ordered paneer tikka biryani which was really bad and i advice you to avoid ordering it.
Overall it's a good place to try out different kinds of biryanis"
2, 3, "Just went due to the zomato rating. Small place, may be 40-45 seater restaurant. Close to offices. Has valet parking, which most of the small restaurants doesn't have. Staff is courteous. They have a daily course meals round the week. Good option instead of buffets. Every item in the platter is good. Nothing wrong to point out. Lighter on pockets, go for it. with Bhaskar Varada"
2, 3, "We ordered from here via swiggy:

We ordered:

Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.

Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.

Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etc
Although we were disappointed that there was no Mushroom."
3, 4, "A decent restaurant with courteous staff and mouth watering Chinese dishes.A good place to go by for Chinese cuisine...sizzler noodles and bamboo rice is a must try for if you can go with less spice!"
2, 3, "It's a pretty good sports bar, so would highly recommend all the cricket lover to visit this place.
The service is pretty slow but the food is pretty standard and quantity is pretty good. Their washroom was under construction so it was a little inconvenient.
Overall pretty good."
2, 3, "It is a good place to be. The ambience is very friendly. The food is on par with what you expect. The prices are decent enough and is not very easy to locate. Although, if you're using Google maps, then it's easy to find."
3, 4, "Am big fan of KS as we are regular customers .we know each and every item and here. They'll take feedback too. And service is slow as crowd was big.. But overall good."
4, 3, "Nice place for desserts. Tried their red velvet cheese cake which was okayish as I am not a fan of the same anyway. And had packed a chocolate cake. The cake was really tasty and filling. It had that rich taste of chocolate and the texture of the cake was amazing. It was packed very well.
These guys are great with their quality and presentation."
0, 2, "New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."
3, 2, "This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."
4, 3, "I tried the buffet dinner. Very good spread both for vegetarians and non vegetarians . The food was good and the staff were friendly too. Will definitely be going there again. Do check out my blog page for more reviews @s.t.a.s.h on instagram."
2, 3, "The parathas actually tastes like an authentic North Indian dish ! Not a big fan of spicy food, but liked the parathas A LOT! For ppl like me who prefer low spice food shall make a special mention !"

We have ordered corn cheese kurkuri which was very good and veg/non veg Biryanis were okay.
Recommend this place to visit once."

2, 3, "A nice place to taste some of the local delicacies..
I really liked the rusty feel this place has, which takes you back in ages..
Loved the started.. although pulao was not the best I‚Äôve had.
Overall, a nice dine out.."
1, 0, "Ordered veg cheese Maggi. Could never expect a simple dish as Maggi to be bland, over-cooked and tasteless. Better to cook at home than order."
0, 2, "Confused waiters.... half order .... items not available.... customization not available... ahhh total chaos.... but surely not truly Chinese... it's more northeast... nepali food as they are more on spicy and oily side. May be I should have tried thupka or some other northeast specialities.
Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed"
1, 4, "It's been a great experience visiting this place. The staff over here ensure that you are served with the best food especially Suraj . When we expressed our concern that the we did not like the grill fish item , they served us fried fish which was not even part of their menu ."
2, 3, "I went to this place for a lunch with my friend. We were the first one to land at the restaurant - sharp @12noon. Yeah! We were actually hungry. I liked the place - decoration was awesome! Cool interior. We ordered Veg Machaow Soup, Masala Papad, butter naan, Paneer Massallam and masala cold drinks. Please do note they give only Masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink. We liked the food, taste was good. But the cold drink was tasteless - I guess it was already opened one so couldn't get the taste bar that everything was good. Ambiance was actually the best - decoration, the and ample space. But service could have been good and fast.

Food - 4/5
Ambiance - 5/5
Service - 4/5

Overall - 4.5/5

Thanks for the hospitality though!"

2, 0, "The ambiance of this place doesn‚Äôt justify the price. Severely over priced. Only with Gold is it ok. Would prefer if they thought of their service and ambience and try and compare with other restaurants out there."
1, 4, "This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!"
2, 3, "They‚Äôve opened up recently and I think they have a long way to reach good management.
Other than beer, I‚Äôve tried their LIT and a classic martini!
They‚Äôve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar.
Food was delicious.
I‚Äôve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

The only problem I faced was table management.
Each time I had to order, I literally had to shout and wave my hands multiple times to get someone‚Äôs attention to my table.

Ambience: 4
Service: 3
Food: 5"
0, 1, "Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid."

Must try is the cock in the basket which is fried chicken breast."

Great service.
Ambience is really good.
And Food is okayish but the vibe makes up for it.
Would definitely recommend"
1, 2, "The only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me. Sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings. Coz the dish looks pretty but..... Similarly, the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich. But at the end wasn't satisfying."
4, 3, "Went here on last friday. I didn't knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went. Food here was Awesome. I had ordered for Dahi Kebab and it was outstanding. The food presentation and quality and taste all were good ... Would certainly love to visit this place again...!!! Hope they keep continuing their good work."
3, 4, "Good ambience.. Great food.. Well I would say best Parathas out there in the area. Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need."

2, 1, "Food is not that much tasty and moreover limited items,limited deserts ,its ok for one time lunch/dinner enjoyed in playing hand football..."
2, 3, "Food: ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes, kafuli, shaam savera and naans, everything was spiced appropriately. Kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet, a tangy taste of tomato gravy.

Service: a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members.

Ambience: it has indoor and outdoor seating both, we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played. Ambience is overall very average.

Value for money: Great. It is actually cheaper than we expected for the quantity and quality of food it served."

0, 1, "Absolutely overhyped place. Substandard biryani and kababs, totally dry and tasteless. No dress code for waiters, hardly any waiters anyway. Pathetic service. I guess each and every place in Hyderabad, which is being talked about, be it pista house or paradise, are totally over hyped."

4, 3, "good"
4, 3, "Goa in Hyderabad!! These guys have cracked this juggernaut .

Ambience - 9/10
Service - 10/10
Food & Drinks - 9/10
Value for Money - 8/10

If you love Goa , this is the place to be in Hyderabad. No wonder they were packed on a weekday ( Wednesday)"
2, 4, "Went there on a Friday, we were only stags but we went there early, at about 6pm. The environment was very energetic, we had great conversations until night and then went to the dance floor. The DJ was amazing, a good mix of English and Hindi songs. Had one of my best night outs here! It was a little on the expensive side though, for 3 people the bill was 9k rs."
3, 2, "I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don‚Äôt have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items."
2, 3, "It's our default choice when we crave Chinese food and if we are around the Gachibowli area. The food tastes great and the fact that they are open all the way from lunch to dinner makes is a very viable option for a decent lunch at odd times in the evening when most other places are closed till dinner. The ambience has nothing to be complained about and the pricing is pretty decent."
2, 3, "Want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you‚Äôre at it , munch on some delicious food? Karachi Cafe , Gachibowli is THE place for you!
Food:
‚Ä¢Peri peri chicken- This dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,Garlic bread and saut√©ed vegetables.
The chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.
‚Ä¢Chicken pesto sandwich- The sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. It has very light taste and perfect meal for two on Hot summer day.
‚Ä¢Bun Maska- Literally the best BUNS you could get your hands on! Filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it‚Äôs literally addictive!

Beverages:
‚Ä¢Cold coffee- The beverage wasn‚Äôt cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. Would not recommend this drink.
‚Ä¢Irani chai- generally Irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn‚Äôt very sugary. It had a mild yet tempting taste . Would definitely recommend.

Ambience: Every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty. Perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family."

The food was smelling too.

I ordered "Steam Naga Fish".

If u really want to eat, get a mask(suggestion)."

once I visited this place for dinner and got to know that they serve very few options for dinner buffet. Dinner buffet is usually for their resident guests and it cost around 700 per person. Though you can enjoy a la carte. Restaurant also have full bar available.

You will definitely love it."

Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
Zomato gold is always an add on benifit .
Every time I go to this place...I come out happy tummy n happy soul .."

It's a must try as it was absolutely filling as well as delicious.

It was a satvik thali which means without onion and garlic used.Still had two stuff parathas made of kuttu ka aata, paneer ki sabzi, sabudana kheer.

Packing was perfect!

Highly Recommended"

I was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
The wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
The dragon prawns were okayish. The sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

Coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
Sanghai fried rice: loved it
Kung pao chicken : delicious
Hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
Shrimp soft noodles: good
Bamboo fried rice: good
Pan fried noodles in Cantonese sauce: a disaster.

For my part I had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

The mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

I loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken. It has stuck on my taste buds.

2, 4, "What a scrumptious dinner at Shanghai chef 2.

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special."

I ordered a Coffee Latey Shake [Rs.169] and my friend ordered a Coffee Caramelo Shake [Rs.169]. Both the shakes were really nice and thick. They are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.

On my second visit to this place I tried it's Go Guava Shake [Rs.145] and it is my favorite. It tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with Guava crush.

I guess I finally seemed to have found it in Hyderabad.

Having been to the best Indian food joints like Grand Trunk, Norfest I guess the Butter Chicken here ranks at the top... Each one of them are good in their own regard though..

I landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through Zomato but through swiggy ( somehow that's an irony given that both deliver the same distance Zomato doesn't deliver from here to my place)

So probably I will not comment on Ambience and Service.. will update that later once I visit the place but food is something that's outstanding

In the last 20 days I would have ordered 3-4 times that's a lot for me given that I don't get fixated to a place as I m more of a food explorer üôÇ.

The food has not disappointed me so far. Items tried so far
Punjabi Butter Chicken - Must Recommend , the best you will find in town
Veg Angara - good
Bhatti kaMurg - must try
Tandoori Momo - can be avoided
Dahi ke kebab - brilliant for vegetarians
Murg Malai Kebab - good
Murg Tikka Masala - must recommend, the best part is that both the gravy's ( of this and butter chicken) are completely different which is hard to find. A person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
Dal Makhani - must try
Tandoori Murgh - must try

So that pretty much sums up my journey with the restaurant for the past 3 weeks.. it's awesome do try if they deliver to ur place.

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla."

My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste.

Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually.

Roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. The lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

Deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. The pork melted in the mouth. Beautifully prepared 5/5

Steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. A weekend special !! 5/5

Kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

Dotsol Bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. A special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

All downed with non-alcoholic (Coolberg) beer.

Honest food prepared with a lot of passion. Absolute value for money. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations."

Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.

We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.

Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

Overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation. Ideal for romantic dates and celebrations. The whole embience is calm and peaceful and makes it best among all @theglassonion"

I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

anyways, they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration, so that was nice."

0, 1, "Ordered chilly paneer with fried rice which tasted really bad. The quantity of the paneer was less and it was so dry. The paneer and fried rice didn't go well together. The taste of the rice was more sour than expected and was difficult to complete it. The package was not taped and the ketchup was missing for which I have paid. Highly disappointed with the service."
0, 1, "Completely disappointed. The staff was clearly reluctant to work.
The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.
We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.
Thoroughly disappointing.
Ambience is the only saving grace for this place.

Attractive and romantic ambience..
Tasty food and very much reasonable...
Good service..
I had chicken breast steaks with mashed potatoes and salad üòã unexpectedly so good taste.
If you are a pasta lover, then do order white sauce pasta.
It tasted incredibly hot and yummy.
As we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
We wrapped up having sea salt Nutella dessert which was heaven of Nutella and different taste.
In recent times I've never been to such a good place with decent crowd and tastyyyy food.
I agree that prices are high but I forgot about the price when I had one spoon of food.

Do visit this place with your loved ones I bet you will have a perfect date."

The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes."

Went with my wife today by seeing the 3.9 stars. The place is small and too much crowded. There are very less number of servers compared to footfalls.

3, 4, "An amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

Closing line... Best hangout place in Gachibowli area."

Expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews."

1, 2, "My second visit to this place. Visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. This visit was better than the last one. Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.

The ambience of this place is decent. There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. Upon requesting, the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney. As we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. They included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and Chilly eggs. Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. Crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.

Veg Tom Yum soup was decent. The main course was a bit disappointing. Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn't actually Kashmiri Pulao. The two other Veg curries tasted average. The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa. This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I've ever eaten.

The service was prompt. But, this place didn't give me any reason to why I should visit again, at least for a buffet. The only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.

I've visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. If they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because I'm not visiting again if I can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.

0, 2, "I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again."
1, 2, "have only one packet of curry instead of 2"
1, 3, "less quantity"
1, 3, "Been there when me and my friend was so hungry after our shopping we ordered a smoky chicken rice bowl. We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good."
3, 4, "Enjoyed a lovely lunch with a friend first time visited the place good food ambience is very nice and a very curtious staff.
Tried the Indian and Chinese items for starters and main course must visit for a good vegetarian meal prices are also pretty reasonable overall 5 star rating for this place."
2, 3, "A fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!

Drinks:

1. Berry blast: Loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. The right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.

2. Green ice mountain mojito: You can find green apples in this drink. A little sour, although i liked it.

I would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.

Teriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. Nothing special about its taste. This is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.

Beef & Pork kimchi bokkum bap: I just liked the flavor of the rice. Both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. They were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. The piece were eatable, and not much chewy.

Pork & Beef Naga chilly curry: The flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. The taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. The gravy is ravishing as well.

Service: Just fine. The waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.

Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate."

Quick feet,friendly and humble staff make your visit a memorable one.
We ordered:
Jade Soup:This could seem a lil bland according to many.But for me spinach broth with sliced garlic was packed with oriental touch.For a change shredded meat in Soup was not rubbery.

Sea Wars : This appetizer was blend of fried prawns,fish and squid .The chilli soy sauce and sweet coriander sauce served on side added a wonderful touch to this delightful dish.

Fook Chook Fried Rice: White sauce (not cream based) topped Fried Rice had a subtle flavor.It was loaded with vegetables.

Honey Noodles with ice cream : Texture of the Noodles here was nothing like the ones I tasted earlier.Fried Noodles had a fudgy Texture with went along real well with thick creamy ice cream.
Fruit punch was decent.But pinacolda has to be improved.
I recommend you to visit this place if you enjoy oriental cuisine sparcely infused with Indian flavors

Service: 1 star. The staff didn't seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us.
Not to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktails(we already read about their slow service so was expecting it)
Non veg food: momos were very average like that of zomos may be.
Veg: the ramyum noodles were literally veg Maggi! Very misleading name and price.
Veg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice."

Various types of salads are available, if you are a weight watcher or you are a conscious eater :)  I went mad over the Hunan Chicken, it was just amazing. Peri Peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it. 

When I went the spread had a mix of Chinese, Italian, Continental, and South & North Indian food. 

The only thing that disappointed me was the mutton. It was a bit undercooked. It was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel.

Desert, I feel they can do a lot more but I can vouch for the baked yogurt, the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugar-free.

This restaurant has Eat India Company and Urban Asia merged into one. So u get both North Indian and Asian cuisine menus together. Bit confusing at the start, especially because the waiters don't address this.
Ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce. Like the dish, could have been less spicy though.
Next up was chicken dumpling. This was yummy.
Chicken Thai red curry was good and creamy, but again was a bit spicy for Thai curry. Think the restaurant needs to tone down the spicy quotient of Asian food, otherwise the food was fresh and tasty."

The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!"
2, 3, "The ambience is quite a steal! Such interiors and those amazing cars and bikes lined up outside üòç A must visit for bikers cause they even have fancy merchandise inside.

This place being really close to our residence, we are frequent visitors. The best part is that it‚Äôs open late in the night hours. You can just have a drink and chill in the outdoor seating area. Pure bliss!

I‚Äôve tried the cafe mocha,mint mocha- strong minty flavour, hot chocolate: all equally good. The snacks are quite average and can be avoided. The chilli cheese toast is a disappointment.

Sizzling brownie was yum and so was pesto pasta though it was slightly overpriced.


One of the cool places to enjoy and try different coffee drinks, I must say. üòáü§òüèΩ"

Overall a very meh experience."

I would highly recommend this place to satiate Paratha Cravings."

3, 4, "Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)
Witte
Beer sampler- (The caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
Dubbel
Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

The food wasn't too oily or spicy. Well flavoured and served warm.

Over all rating- 4.5/5 ( Only because there pricey)
Food- 4/5
Drinks- 4.9/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service- 4.5/5

Would I go back here? Hell yes"

1, 2, "#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."
3, 2, "Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"

4, 3, "Went to this amazing place quite sometime back. It's a very pretty, romantic place for a fine dining experience.

Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.

Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

Must try: Forest mushroom soup, Crispy corn pepper salt, Quattro Formaggi, Tiramisu

Would actually give it a 4.5/5"

We were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time. Food was okay not that great taste, the chicken wings were good though. Choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time. Chicken quesadillas didn‚Äôt taste like a quesadilla. It was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti. There is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time."

2, 3, "Pros:
Awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen.
Cool ambience.
They always have the best DJs.
Cons:
Too much Vip culture. Almost all the tables are reserved. It's almost impossible to get a table. You are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the VIPs. Even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. Entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. After paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

But hey if you love dancing, there's no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this."

Eat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.

When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.

Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.

In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.

After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill."

Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

Booking is preferred on Friday's as it gets too much crowdy after 1pm. Staff isnt courteous at all. They always keep a sad face dont know why. Hopefully they are given some training to smile. Biryani taste is amazing. As I am vegetarian, i usually take Andhra Veg Biryani, Avakaya Biryani or Kaju Biryani. All of them are perfectly made. So all the rating is for only the taste, not for service and ambiance at all."

Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."

1, 2, "Great ambiance with very poor service.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves."

2, 3, "Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).

The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies."

1, 2, "The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of "FRESH" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."
2, 3, "After a long time wish to visit Radisson, today we got to visit this place with my team..buffet spread was very good..welcome drink was coconut water..which is fantastic idea as this is summer season..coming to starters veg I tried sabudana vada which is excellent in taste..other starters of veg was normal..kodi vepudu of non veg stater was good and spice level was also good..chicken biryani was also good in taste..
As it's ramzan season they also served haleem which is not good in taste..disappointed for haleem..
Coming to starters kubani ka meeta and semiya was good..overall a nice experience!!üòä"

2, 3, "Ended up this place just before holi and it was a dry day, hardly 2 tables were occupied. Starters were really good specially chicken tikka periperi and main course was good but too oily, biryani disappointed us as there is no masala flavor just topped with paneer tikka pieces. Over all it was Just okay they need to improve on service also as I did not find staff so friendly.

We had gone for Ritviz's show which was a super duper hit. They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well). The ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any."

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

2, 3, "#BrownieLove  # BakedWithLove

Classic calm interior. I loved their theme color "Blue". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. 

Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best. 
One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. 
Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. 

Suggestion: 
I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here. 
Why not offer a single piece or small one person box (3-4 pieces may be)."
2, 3, "Nice place very good food but main course should be be improved because starters 4 dessert 4 and main course 3.5 because food in main course was not upto mark need some taste build up"
3, 4, "Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I‚Äôd complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush."

I don't think they understand the ingredients of the type of coffee that you order.coz I had asked for a strong cappuccino and what was offered was more on the terms of a milky latte.

The food, well I had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayish.I don't know how the keema pav tasted though.

The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don‚Äôt like sweet dishes. May be it‚Äôs the authentic Orange Chicken)

1, 2, "I ordered noodles and manchurian combo from this place, first of all i would like to suggest management to send fork along with the food as they have only sent the spoons and needless to say you cannot eat noodles from spoon. second the quantity was really less of manchurian. some improvement in food is suggested"

There is a small juice counter outside the restaurant as well.

If you are looking for ambience then this place is not a great option but taste wise and cost wise it won't disappoint you!

Happy eating! :)"

My friend and I come here once in a while to catch up and we just love this Cafe. It's so cute, quiet, and very pretty. I love the theme. I'm not really sure how the food is. We've had their Mawa cake which goes great with the Chai and the paneer sub which wasn't that great. But nonetheless, it's one of my favorite places."

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you‚Äôre interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!"
0, 1, "I ordered their Special Chicken Shawarma from Zomato. First look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. The quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.It is not at all good. The chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. It usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.The quality needs to improve a lot.
Stay healthy. Keep eating..not from here.
Cheers"

So I have tried their brunch many times, and I can finally say that for the cost, their Sunday brunch is good but they need a little more spread and little more taste. Also the staff is sweet but very slow on brunch days since they expect self service on that day."

Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place."

3, 4, "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ‚ù§Ô∏è
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. üòç The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

Taste wise : 4.5/5
Price: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Allover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)"
1, 2, "When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food. Very disappointed on my next two visits;They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers, seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract."
1, 2, "First visit

1. Garlic Fried rice - good
2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup."
2, 3, "Really good place in gachibowli. Ambience is average. But good place with good vibes and crowd. They have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. Open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. They have a dance floor. There are karaoke nights as well. On weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. Entry is from side in the building SLN terminus. lunch menus are bad. Food is just average here. Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun."
3, 2, "ok"
1, 2, "Been to this place with my friends today, Let me start with the good part first, ordered "Bamboo chicken" as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge.

As part of main course we ordered "Rayala vari kodi pulao" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped "Raju gari kodi pulao", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.

In short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.
Bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing (INR 435) is high for the quantity we get."

1, 2, "Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the "Signature" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."
1, 2, "I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together."

I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience."

Rest assured was average.
Not so crowded either
Chopsey tasted like honey. Not up to the mark
It was chinese . It had to be a little spicy but a dissapointment.
Soup and starters were okay.
Also they switched off the A.C even when it wasnt late. Need to improve."

Food - starters are tasty, they don't have more variety in main course for veg people but whatever they served was tasty also I feel there should be some more variety of sweets as when we went to this place we found only ice cream, cake and some halwa. We visited this place around 2-2:15 p.m and we were only left in the restaurant and I believe it was there closing time so they couldn't give more attention to us. This restaurant is worth giving a try.
Team DP one suggestion add some variety in sweets."

When we called the manager, there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty.
The ambience is good though. If only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating.

# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei " huddi" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.
Like 50% of an all."

After finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i‚Äôll try some more.

Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.
They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.

With all the taste, ambience and service it is totally worth eating.

Only thing I would complain about was staff need more clarity on Zomato gold as I was being given wrong bill and it took me sometime to make them understand that there way of deduction does not comply with T&C given by Zomato, hope that is taken care so as no other customer face the inconvenience."

2, 3, "it's OK, little spicy."
2, 4, "Starters:
üç¥Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
üç¥Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
üçΩÔ∏è Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
üçΩÔ∏è Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
üçπSummer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
üçπFresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"

The place usually packed but you would definitely find a table. Staff is polite and friendly.
Coming to food.... There is so much on the menu to try on.
Pork ribs are most recommended but they are only available on weekends.
Beef with onions and chilly is good. They come with complimentary rice which is unlike normal indian rice. More like how Koreans eat.

In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."

Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."

3. Hindi music after 10pm even on week days

Yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
That is a negative of the management over there.
Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding
And lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.

‚ñ™Mint mocha - which tasted OK
‚ñ™Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
‚ñ™Mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
‚ñ™coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
‚ñ™vegetarian cafe
‚ñ™good location
‚ñ™good music
‚ñ™they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low.

2, 1, "After hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a Sunday.
Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

Used Zomato Gold here."

To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."

4, 3, "I ordered chicken Buryani. It's so tasty.
The packing was awesome.
The quantity - easily it's enough for 2people.
Raitha, gravy all are good .
And 1sweet. Gulabjamoon. üëåüëåüëå.
Mainly packing and look is too good. I suggested it to my friends they also loved it."
4, 3, "First things first.... Faasos have always been the first name that comes to mind when it comes to huge sized Appetite fulfilling wraps.
I haven't come across any other place which delivers these kind of huge juicy warps with this amount of filling.

Tried their cheesy chicken jumbo wrap and chicken jumbo wrap and believe me you'll be full to your throat with just one wrap. Besides the quantity they also maintain quality with the wraps being flavourful and cheesy üëåüëå

Overall if you are looking for NO SALAD only chicken wraps which are my kind of things faasos won't disappoint you for sure!"
2, 3, "I visited 3 month ago it was good but it was very spicy .. ans somewhat costly also interior is good as well behavior of stap members........."
3, 2, "Caramel Brownie was the best I could grab here and I strongly recommend the same...

When it comes to snacks they have potato wedges and french fries with multiple flavors...

A decent outlet that can accommodate around 12 visitors.. pretty clean and pleasant ambiance...

The service could ha e been a little better, I always look out for friendlg staffs !"

1, 2, "Had a family lunch while on a visit to Hyderabad. Suggested by my son settled for the meal.

We went with the suggestion of the Steward, for starters had Mushroom on khari, turned out to be a good choice.
Son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket. He was okay.

Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. Turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.

Finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu. A bigger disappointment."
3, 2, "Probably one of the most pocket friendly buffet places in the city. The place is spacious and the food tastes good. This is the apt place for small team lunch. The ambience of the place is good and there is TV provided to entertain you.
The service is extremely good.
