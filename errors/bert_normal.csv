2, 3, "Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!"

We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,
Ambience - 5/5
Dj-5/5
Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Will recommend for partys with friends!!"

This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying.."
0, 2, "curd rice not good"
3, 2, "I had ordered out everytime. The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish. The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken. The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist. There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette. Also their waffles are okayish too."
4, 3, "One of the best places to get your bakery and dessert requirements fixed!
They have been so goood with what they do they have become a household name to reckon with.
Rainbow pastry and fruit biscuits are the one to die for!
Keep the flag high!"
4, 3, "The food is really good and waiter Narender is very enthusiastic with his work. Ambience is just ok and starters are awesome. Main course is just ok and deserts are available with different varieties. 5star rating for Narendra for his work and service."
3, 2, "Nice ambiance. Food is good to average nothing to write home about ?. My only complaint is the portion size which is a tad smaller for the money u r paying. We ordered hariyali tikka which was too soft n yummy. One crispy fried chicken whose actual name I forgot. Overall a nice experience partly due to the courteous staff but food portion is something that can be looked into."
3, 2, "Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The d√©cor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."
3, 4, "Good food and Great Ambience... Nice place to have Mandi..and this place offers variety of Arabian, Turkish recipes too..Also a great place to take clicks..."

Late night #needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in DLF for every hungry soul out der but this time I though to order it to my office for my evening hunger. I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5. I haven't tried the Momo's yet, will add to the review once I try them.

I am sure you have already had this sometime, if not you should surely try coz who doesn't like Maggie right!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @hungermaggipoint üòÄ"

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us."

Dragon Chicken and Hariyali fish is a must try. Chiken pahadi was good as well. They have two varieties of Mandi, fish fried mandi and chicken grilled Mandi, the presentation was excellent. I‚Äôm in love with the chicken Mandi here. They have a variety of milkshakes and deserts. Kaddu ki kheer was delicious . Lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell."

Beet part, they allows stack on weekend s."
3, 4, "I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could‚Äôve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you‚Äôll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!"

1, 0, "Nasi Goreng, Kung pao chicken & burnt garlic chicken were really spicy & over powered with chilly flakes! Looked & tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it! The saving grace was the Indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice. Really upset with tonight‚Äôs order."
4, 3, "The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? üòÉ

Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.

Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.

Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!"
0, 1, "Visited this restaurant thinking to have good food, but the efforts were wasted. We went on a Friday and we started eating the starters. After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.

Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.

Two stars only for the ambience.

2, 1, "A small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. At first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for Chinese food in gachibowli. Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen."
1, 2, "This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
3, 4, "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
2, 3, "We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

Taste: 3.5/5

3, 4, "Went there two times and ordered one same dish i.e. Grilled fish with rice and I must say it's flawless...it should be there signature dish.
Other dishes were tasty too. Liked their service...well trained staff. Overall a good place to enjoy."
3, 4, "A decent restaurant with courteous staff and mouth watering Chinese dishes.A good place to go by for Chinese cuisine...sizzler noodles and bamboo rice is a must try for if you can go with less spice!"
2, 3, "It is a good place to be. The ambience is very friendly. The food is on par with what you expect. The prices are decent enough and is not very easy to locate. Although, if you're using Google maps, then it's easy to find."

0, 2, "New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."
3, 2, "This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."

Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed"
3, 4, "It's been a great experience visiting this place. The staff over here ensure that you are served with the best food especially Suraj . When we expressed our concern that the we did not like the grill fish item , they served us fried fish which was not even part of their menu ."

3, 4, "This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!"
3, 2, "Ordered paav bhaji chole bhature and papdi chat!
But they forgot to deliver the chat!I was a bit disappointed by that.But the taste was good."
2, 1, "Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid."
3, 4, "With great music and ambience the excitement for the final IPL match was enhanced.
The food is great along with the exotic drinks.
Must try is the cock in the basket which is fried chicken breast."

4, 3, "Went here on last friday. I didn't knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went. Food here was Awesome. I had ordered for Dahi Kebab and it was outstanding. The food presentation and quality and taste all were good ... Would certainly love to visit this place again...!!! Hope they keep continuing their good work."
3, 4, "Good ambience.. Great food.. Well I would say best Parathas out there in the area. Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need."

Food I should say is not so appealing...very tough to recommend or think of any standout...Butter Roti is good in breads
Service is good I should say...
Let's talk about Don't Trys:
Manchow Soup
Mushroom Starters (as a mushroom fan..disappointment)
This place would be in my choices with hangouts as priority and not food"
3, 4, "It was Lunch time at Office and i did not bring my lunch box. Ordered a China Combo at just 129.
Wen i got my food, i was amazed by the platter. It was so much food for just 129! and everything was yummmm. It felt like authentic chinese. Moreover all my colleagues tated the food and loved it. Great going Squeeze @ The Lime. You guys made my hectic day very pleasant.
Loved it totally.
From now on everyday without lunch box at office would be Squeeze @ The Lime day."
2, 3, "Food: ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes, kafuli, shaam savera and naans, everything was spiced appropriately. Kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet, a tangy taste of tomato gravy.

Service: a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members.

Ambience: it has indoor and outdoor seating both, we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played. Ambience is overall very average.

Value for money: Great. It is actually cheaper than we expected for the quantity and quality of food it served."

The DJ was amazing, a good mix of English and Hindi songs. Had one of my best night outs here! It was a little on the expensive side though, for 3 people the bill was 9k rs."
3, 2, "I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don‚Äôt have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items."

The food was smelling too.

I ordered "Steam Naga Fish".

If u really want to eat, get a mask(suggestion)."
2, 3, "They sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good.

3, 4, "My friend ordered the Ulavacharu Chicken Bone Pulao from T-Grill. The price was high, but the taste justified it. It is one of the spicier foods I tried in Hyderabad. I always though Hyderabadi food was spicy. But, I never came across anything very spicy. This one was spicy enough to be memorable. It's one of the best pulaos I've ever had. You will definitely love it."
3, 4, "Ordered Meals(Dal makhni + Rice + roti + Aloo Gobhi). Tastes really good and was fulfilling too. Just one thing, if you could include some plastic cutlery, So that we can pour curries into the bowls. It is difficult to manage this in office without cutlery."
3, 4, "Went to this place for lunch. Opted for a Set Menu with the on going Dim Sun Festival. Soup was good. Dim sums were awesome and they served a wide variety of Bao, Gyoza, Dim Sum, Wonton. Main Couse was ok with Rice and Noodles. Desert was Fried Banana in Caramel Sauce with ice cream. Desert was good as well.

2, 1, "Had a very disappointing experience here today. We had been eyeing this place since long and planned our brunch to be had here. Loved the place, it was spacious and the ambiance was really good. The first thing I ordered was coffee but they were not serving any hot beverages. Next wanted to try pizza as they serve in different shapes but that too was unavailable. Did not felt like ordering anything after this. Highly disappointed."
3, 4, "What a scrumptious dinner at Shanghai chef 2.

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special."

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."

They also offer Lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal Hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (A typical awadhi pulaao). Overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your North Indian taste buds!"

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla."

I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake."

Ambiance- 3.5/5
It has a black theme with modern crafty ceilings & is dimly lit but not dark. One of the pleasant ambiance around that area, best for evenings with friends/ colleagues. The seating was not very comfortable. They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!

My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes."

No doubt service is good , staff is always smiling. But they need to improve a lot on food quality. Even the biryani was not up to the mark. Moreover the chicken was undercooked or old, our stomach felt funny when we reached home."

Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers."

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so, it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience.

the food was good, service was ok (surprisingly!!!), price is also okish
(a bit pricey u can say)
rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

anyways, they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration, so that was nice."

The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.
We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.
Thoroughly disappointing.
Ambience is the only saving grace for this place.

The cinderella mock-tail was insanely sweet, no one at our table could finish it. Despite promising us for over an hour to find us an indoor table, they sat us outdoor with the mosquitos which they weren‚Äôt able to control with citronella sticks.

As we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
We wrapped up having sea salt Nutella dessert which was heaven of Nutella and different taste.

The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes."

Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

4, 3, "Food taste was good and quality was also nice."
1, 2, "I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good."

Not many on the menu to chose from but they put up what they make the best and live up to it. Could add a little chinese main course on the menu but thats ok. Try the variety of drinks they serve and groove to their lovely choice of music. Enough eye candy for the guys and a fab ladies night for the girls. That day when you crack a head at office walkin here for some peace. Tiki time!"

Staff is a bit clueless (lazy service). Overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes. Nothing great or distinctive. This review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time."

They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.

The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

The ambience is good but the service, quality and quantity of food is amazing. We had soup which was good and as a part of starters we had ginger chicken which was really amazing.
For main course we had hakka noodles with chicken in spicy black bean sauce and mongolian chicken. I must say all of them were really amazing and had a great quantity and quality is beyond words.
Then in desert we had chocolate mousse and chocolate volcano with vanilla ice cream.
Mousse was good but the volcano was really really good.

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."
3, 2, "Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"
3, 4, "This restaurant was too good in serving food - both quantity and quality wise. All the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity. Ambience was good. We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)"

Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.

Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

Must try: Forest mushroom soup, Crispy corn pepper salt, Quattro Formaggi, Tiramisu

A super-hit club of Jubilee Hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit

3, 4, "Though the brand's famous for donuts, I'd have to start the review with their Burger. After having got bored with McD, KFC and other popular burger places, DD's burgers are just stunning. Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

Booking is preferred on Friday's as it gets too much crowdy after 1pm. Staff isnt courteous at all. They always keep a sad face dont know why. Hopefully they are given some training to smile. Biryani taste is amazing. As I am vegetarian, i usually take Andhra Veg Biryani, Avakaya Biryani or Kaju Biryani. All of them are perfectly made. So all the rating is for only the taste, not for service and ambiance at all."

Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."

The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.

1, 2, "I can't say the donuts are too tasty.if you are a sweet lover you can once try this.we ordered a pack of six and I felt no difference in each of these ,in taste they look similar except the yellow one(mango flavoured).

I didn't even feel it as fresh one ,as soon as I ordered he bought the one which he has packed it and kept as stock.overall, I was disappointed for the first time being there.

Once you can try this as a snack, but it's too sweet.
Ambience i can rate as 3.5/5

3, 4, "The largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in Hyderabad. I was surprised by the choices on offer. Spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast.
- cereals, breads, pastries
- eggs, grilled vegetables, breakfast smoothies, sausages
-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema
- cheese and cold cuts
- fresh fruits
I have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.

Service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. I won‚Äôt hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it!"
2, 3, "Over all good experience but

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

Pros: Price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing. The way DJ plays music is awesome, He makes even non-dancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing"
2, 3, "Rice quantity is less compared to earlier."
1, 2, "Great ambiance with very poor service.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves."

Not at all overpriced."

2, 3, "Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).

The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies."
4, 3, "Went for dinner with friends and family several times. The place has a great ambience and really good food. Their aloo tikki chaat and hara subz kebab (main course) are our all time favourites.

1, 2, "The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of "FRESH" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."
2, 3, "After a long time wish to visit Radisson, today we got to visit this place with my team..buffet spread was very good..welcome drink was coconut water..which is fantastic idea as this is summer season..coming to starters veg I tried sabudana vada which is excellent in taste..other starters of veg was normal..kodi vepudu of non veg stater was good and spice level was also good..chicken biryani was also good in taste..
As it's ramzan season they also served haleem which is not good in taste..disappointed for haleem..
Coming to starters kubani ka meeta and semiya was good..overall a nice experience!!üòä"

Starters were really good specially chicken tikka periperi and main course was good but too oily, biryani disappointed us as there is no masala flavor just topped with paneer tikka pieces. Over all it was Just okay they need to improve on service also as I did not find staff so friendly.

Coming to English bf they have provided fruit bread ,wheat bread and also milk bread and you can toast them also.They gave 2 variety of cakes one pastry and other cup cake. They have also given roasted tomato along with mynassie.One more is crossient and watermelon juice and fruits.

We had gone for Ritviz's show which was a super duper hit. They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well). The ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any."

2, 3, "This place has freshly baked stuff, probably the best you'd find in this locality but the beverages are just about average!

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

Pretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!"

3, 4, "Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."

My biggest surprise with vada and Bamboo chicken biryani. Vada with chicken curry, bamboo chicken biryani with chicken gravy made my day. Wide variety of desserts are to a special mention. Hotel management is very friendly and helped to make our experience much better. Most recommended place if you are a lover of buffets."

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I‚Äôd complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush."

Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!! Not a highly preferred place, however, you can visit for the experience of high end hospitality!"

But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don‚Äôt like sweet dishes. May be it‚Äôs the authentic Orange Chicken)
All together good experience. Staff is also very courteous and professional."

Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place."

0, 1, "The food here was ok. But the service was worst ever. If you have 3-4hrs free time to spend then come here. The service is slow as sloth. We ordered starters got it after 30min. Then got lunch after an hour. I guess they forget orders after you give them, you have to remind them atleast twice or thrice to get it."
3, 4, "I ordered a dish which is not there in the menu. There were kind enough to make it for me. Paneer was soft and gravy was rich. Thank you we enjoyed it. Will definitely order again."
3, 2, "If you are looking for some good north Indian food within your budget then you should give a try here . This restaurant serves decent food but there is no ambience so don't set your expectations for it . I have tried Paneer dishes and Chinese and those are really good."
4, 3, "One of the best cafes I have been to. Hood ambience and good food.
What adds to the feel are the bikes n cars . Lovely to see everything at a single place.
Staff are courteous. Coffee is good.
Really loved the Red sause pasta."
2, 3, "Visited the Gachibowli branch of Tiki Shak on a Sunday evening.
The place is very well placed in a very accessible area of Gachibowli.
It's a rooftop bar, hence the ambience was pretty amazing. They have Nicely set up indoor and outdoor seating areas.

We ordered :

Jalapeno Cheese poppers - 4/5 - Yummy cheese filled balls with right amount of spices and jalapenos.

Aloo Pakode - 3.5/5 - Pretty normal with a homely taste to it

Overall it was a good experience. The place also offers 2+2 on drinks which can also be used on mocktails ( Just in case you are not a fan of alcohol )."

Overall a bad experience."
2, 4, "I had a good experience .
This was my first time in zings northeast kitchen.
The starters were good .
But I was disappointed when I got two of my orders not available.
Next time when I visit I would love to have those starters too .
Lots of love .
Thank you ."
3, 4, "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ‚ù§Ô∏è
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. üòç The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

Taste wise : 4.5/5
Price: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Allover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)"
1, 2, "First visit

1. Garlic Fried rice - good
2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup."
2, 3, "Really good place in gachibowli. Ambience is average. But good place with good vibes and crowd. They have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. Open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. They have a dance floor. There are karaoke nights as well. On weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. Entry is from side in the building SLN terminus. lunch menus are bad. Food is just average here. Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun."
1, 2, "Been to this place with my friends today, Let me start with the good part first, ordered "Bamboo chicken" as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge.

As part of main course we ordered "Rayala vari kodi pulao" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped "Raju gari kodi pulao", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.

In short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.
Bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing (INR 435) is high for the quantity we get."

Not willing to visit again..( would give 2.5 if had a choice)"

1, 2, "Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the "Signature" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."

They were good too...to scale up i would say must visit it to enjoy it."

All the starters and main course are good in taste and quality, chicken biryani is one of the best made which I prefer to eat at least a cup only in this restaurant for buffet. You have enough deserts and salads to choose. A welcome drink which is very less in quantity but it worth to eat more üòä"

Placed order from zomato for special rumali shawarma which is for rs:120/- which is totally worth trust me.

It is so delicious, one must try at any cost.

Request for less spicy, usually they make very spicy"

I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience."

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."

Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed üç∫ (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table."
3, 2, "Catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance. As this place is mainly a bar, it is not sensible to comment on the food. The spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good. Pricing is also decent."

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste."

If you are bored of the usuals like McDonald‚Äôs and Burger King, do try the burgers at Dunkin Donuts and give the titular donuts a complete pass; they are dry and the toppings too sweet. I always remember the burgers from Dunkin Donuts as crisp, tasty and juicy and that‚Äôs exactly how the Big Joy Veg Burger was when I tried it last weekend. Truly a Big Joy!"

Must try items here are alu kucha ,chole bahturae ,alu onion paratha and sweet lassi.

This place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here who,this place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad.

Giving 5 start only for food,do no expect any kind of ambiance , visit this place only if you eat punjabi food."

Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving.

It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!"

A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice. It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours. I absolutely loved it.
Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu. I did not find anything very special in it. Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there."

2, 4, "# DJ Hardcore Saturdays
# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."

1, 2, "Dissatisfaction and Disappointment!

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei " huddi" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.

After finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i‚Äôll try some more.

Value for Money - 5/5
With all the taste, ambience and service it is totally worth eating.

Only thing I would complain about was staff need more clarity on Zomato gold as I was being given wrong bill and it took me sometime to make them understand that there way of deduction does not comply with T&C given by Zomato, hope that is taken care so as no other customer face the inconvenience."

3, 4, "Starters:
üç¥Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
üç¥Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
üçΩÔ∏è Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
üçΩÔ∏è Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
üçπSummer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
üçπFresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"
2, 0, "Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."

Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."
2, 3, "I have visited the place on 3 occasions, twice on weekends and once in weekday. Getting seats on weekends is very difficult. Also, the entry is charged for couple as well as stag, however it is covered in bill.

Pros:
1. Great ambience
2. Very big dance floor
3. Hindi music after 10pm even on week days
4. Food is Fine.

Cons:
1. Uncomfortable sitting, especially if wearing short dresses.
2. On weekends, service is very slow.
3. Drinks are tooooo expensive and can easily cause a dent on pocket."

Ambience was ok types, not so appealing. Crockery used for service was good.
Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can‚Äôt eat.
Steam rice was salty too.
Frankly speak, we did not like food except reshami kabab. Rest of food was pathetic."
2, 1, "The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. 
Neways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.

Service: 2

Yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
That is a negative of the management over there.
Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding
And lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.
They want us to give the rating infront of them

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."

Mainly packing and look is too good. I suggested it to my friends they also loved it."

I haven't come across any other place which delivers these kind of huge juicy warps with this amount of filling.

Tried their cheesy chicken jumbo wrap and chicken jumbo wrap and believe me you'll be full to your throat with just one wrap. Besides the quantity they also maintain quality with the wraps being flavourful and cheesy üëåüëå

Overall if you are looking for NO SALAD only chicken wraps which are my kind of things faasos won't disappoint you for sure!"

When it comes to snacks they have potato wedges and french fries with multiple flavors...

A decent outlet that can accommodate around 12 visitors.. pretty clean and pleasant ambiance...

The service could ha e been a little better, I always look out for friendlg staffs !"
