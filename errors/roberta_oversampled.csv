3, 4, "I absolutely love ordering from this place for all special occasions. I make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever I am visiting my parents.
This place is pretty expensive and there’s no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year, it’s so worth it.
I have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but I have tried their sample cakes multiple times and I can’t wait to order them.
Note: they usually need advance orders so give your order on time and they are closed on Sundays so make sure that you call and confirm before making the trip."

We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,
Ambience - 5/5
Dj-5/5
Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Will recommend for partys with friends!!"

4, 3, "Visited Hyderabadi Daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. Surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. Wondered why we have not visited this place before. A definite must visit from me. Keep it up team HD. You rock!!!!"

This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying.."

3, 2, "Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The décor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."
3, 4, "Good food and Great Ambience... Nice place to have Mandi..and this place offers variety of Arabian, Turkish recipes too..Also a great place to take clicks..."

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us."

3, 4, "I had a food session here. The service was very nice and food was nice too. They have this two amazing varieties of soups, Arabianchicken soup and lemon coriander soup, which were amazing. Dragon Chicken and Hariyali fish is a must try. Chiken pahadi was good as well. They have two varieties of Mandi, fish fried mandi and chicken grilled Mandi, the presentation was excellent. I’m in love with the chicken Mandi here. They have a variety of milkshakes and deserts. Kaddu ki kheer was delicious . Lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell."

Disappointed."

Beet part, they allows stack on weekend s."
3, 4, "I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could’ve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you’ll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!"
2, 1, "rotis not baked well"

Cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend trying(though it's pretty small) . Death by Chocolate cake was not fresh, and had that sugary texture to it. It was really disappointing."

1, 0, "Nasi Goreng, Kung pao chicken & burnt garlic chicken were really spicy & over powered with chilly flakes! Looked & tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it! The saving grace was the Indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice. Really upset with tonight’s order."
2, 1, "Visited this restaurant thinking to have good food, but the efforts were wasted. We went on a Friday and we started eating the starters. After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.

Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.

Two stars only for the ambience.

2, 3, "Tasty food. However wrong chutney was sent"
1, 2, "This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
3, 4, "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
3, 4, "Went for the dinner with the family. All the items were delicious. You must try the firni in deserts.
Dont miss the platter and mouth watering non veg platters."

Chiken biriyani is very good and
Nice place in paradise gachibowli
I am happy and enjoy the food
And service is very good"
2, 3, "We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

Taste: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5"
2, 3, "We ordered from here via swiggy:

We ordered:

Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.

Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.

Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etc
Although we were disappointed that there was no Mushroom."

1, 2, "New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."

Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."

Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy.

1, 0, "Visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. Not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won’t pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn’t noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered “papdi paneer kebab” as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

Highly disappointed."

Food quality and staff slowness made me horrible.
Seems they have done some renovation recently, which give something new and good feeling. But to be honest, in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service. And if this is not maintained then there is no meaning ..!
All the best guys and please do some deep thinking and improve the food quality and service part."
1, 0, "Yesterday, as always I went out for family dinner. We wanted to try something new. My wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on Google. As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good. 
Very disappointing experience from Sheraton. I have to think about my relation with Sheraton in the future."

3, 2, "I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don’t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items."

The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
Zomato gold is always an add on benifit .
Every time I go to this place...I come out happy tummy n happy soul .."

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ❤️❤️❤️

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special."

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."

They also offer Lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal Hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (A typical awadhi pulaao). Overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your North Indian taste buds!"

Thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice.. The burger just melts in your mouth.. Must visit place for bbq lovers.."

Overall a great experience!"

A quaint little place opposite SLN Terminus, this joint serves authentic Tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover's delight. We had ordered Minty Cucumber in mocktails, a Korean appetizer Tangsuyuk, Kalbi Bokum, Smoked Pork fried with Bamboo Shoots and Teriyaki Chicken. All the dishes tasted good, the Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet though.

1, 0, "I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don’t think I would go back there again."

They have different flavours to pic from. We had alfanso, fruit exotica and ferrero rocher. Exquisite desserts with unique taste. I loved the alphanso. They chopped these mangos over the yummy icecream.
Highly recommended. 😇"

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!

My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes."

Reached this place, got a seat which had full of mosquitoes.I can't argue much of it as it was a open space, but they dint attempt to place a mosquito coil. The service guy was least attentive. We needed to search him to place the order .So ordered tandoori chicken boneless, harabara kebab n veg pulav.The very first bite but tears in my eyes as it was very very very spicy & harabara kabab's spice level so beyond my imagination.We just couldn't eat it. We asked them no make the pulav least spicy. But this one was like a bomb. We all went to have a good time but dint get anything of this sort. Will never try this place again.

Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers."

Visited Zing’s Northeast Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I wasn’t disappointed at all. We ordered for :

Roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. The lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

Deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. The pork melted in the mouth. Beautifully prepared 5/5

Steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. A weekend special !! 5/5

Kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

Dotsol Bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. A special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

All downed with non-alcoholic (Coolberg) beer.

Honest food prepared with a lot of passion. Absolute value for money. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations."

I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.

We ordered mutton galauti kebab, mirchi chicken Tikka and paneer tikka for starters.. What place doesn't have mint chutney when you serve kebabs..?! Yes, they dint have mint chutney.. And galauti kebab was so difficult to finish..

Pata soup was no better too.. In main course we ordered Tikka biryani and veg biryani.. And they dint have mirchi ka salan in this.. Tikka biryani was sweet on taste.. It actually tasted like drumstick curry to me.. Such weird analogy but true.. Raita was the only thing I liked of all..

Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.

3, 4, "An amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

Closing line... Best hangout place in Gachibowli area."

The dal makhani was tolerable (but not good). Since it's mango season, expected the mango lassi to be made of fresh ingredients (our fault for not checking). Expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews."

We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good."
3, 4, "This place never disappoints me. Never. Totally love the nachos chaat in the starters- prepared warm, crispy with right dose of sour and sweet flavours. Paav bhaji is also very good. In main course, their paneer bhurji combo is my all time favourite. Also must try is Lasagna at this place. Byw, I love how they give you good quantity of food as well. The staff is super courteous."

Not many on the menu to chose from but they put up what they make the best and live up to it. Could add a little chinese main course on the menu but thats ok. Try the variety of drinks they serve and groove to their lovely choice of music. Enough eye candy for the guys and a fab ladies night for the girls. That day when you crack a head at office walkin here for some peace. Tiki time!"
1, 2, "too late to serve"
3, 2, "Been here for lunch and opted for ala carte..

Must trys - corn cubes
Turn offs - extremely slow service, desserts

FOOD - 3.5/5 - tried corn cubes, crispy potato with butter chilli garlic sauce, paneer lababdar, mint and lemon Ice cream.

Corn cubes 5/5 - one of their unqiue dishes. Simply loved it. A highly recommended starters you need to try here.

Crispy Potato 4/5 - tasty and light!

Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.

Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.

Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.

AMBIENCE 4/5 - decent ambience for a family dining..

SERVICE 2/5 - extremely slow. Had to remind 2-3 times to get our order. This definitely has to be improvised."

1. Great place for a team outing. You get your space

1. Not much choice for vegetarians
2. Too costly for its quality"
1, 2, "I just wonder how people praise the food and service.
Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate."

3, 4, "The service and ambience here is great! Jayanta hasubul atm were very customer obsessed. Starters for both veg and non veg are good. For kids too they provide balloons and a small toy to play with 😃. I definitely recommend this place. The ice cream taste should be improved."
3, 2, "I quite like the sumptuous North Indian and South Indian vegetarian thalis at this place. Served hot. Reasonably priced. Not too fond of ala carte here, though I must add it is still better than a lot of places. The ambience and simple aesthetics of the place make it a great place for Sunday lunch with family."

Staff is a bit clueless (lazy service). Overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes. Nothing great or distinctive. This review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time."

Lasagne is a must try here..

Items on the menu aren’t available but offered what they had at that time. Rice was watery, none to care for your concern but were commenting on what was wrong and it was eatable. Will never come here again."

They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.
You would find plethora of coffee. It is paradise for a black coffee person.The way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.You are the best,Driven cafe.You have my heart.

The place has good service too, the servers are helpful.
Mustang has zomato gold so that's an added incentive to go.
We ordered nachos which was a big disappointment because either they were not baked properly or they were old they tasted weird.
Fir veg pizzas their options aren't that great. So we ended up orsering the Greek pizza twice but dint regret it even a bit. The Greek pizza is the safest and the best bet in their menu."

People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again"

But the absolute let down was the pan seared fish with tomatoes. The fish was not done properly, no crispy skin and was a bit smelly. There was ice-cream too.. The service was amazing and so was the ambiance."
3, 4, "The place is open seating, gives a good airy feeling. Music is good and it had occupancy on a week day.

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!"

3, 4, "Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)
Witte
Beer sampler- (The caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
Dubbel
Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

The food wasn't too oily or spicy. Well flavoured and served warm.

Over all rating- 4.5/5 ( Only because there pricey)
Food- 4/5
Drinks- 4.9/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service- 4.5/5

Would I go back here? Hell yes"

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."

We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)"

You are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the VIPs. Even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. Entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. After paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

But hey if you love dancing, there's no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this."
1, 0, "The place is overrated, we went on a Friday afternoon, it was too crowded, had to wait for 15 mins to get a table, once we got the table, order was taken after 15 mins which made it 30 mins of waiting, we had to run behind the waiter to take the order, order was then taken, we had Apollo fish, kung pao chicken and juicy mutton mandi, the fish tasted good, chicken was not cooked properly, coming to mandi, it tasted like we were having boiled mutton with rice, wasn't great at all, and the mandi was around 585rs, I'd rather spend that elsewhere and get 2 mandis for around 600.
Not at all worth, checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed."
2, 3, "It is that kind of place which wouldn't cost you an arm and a leg when you eat to your hearts (and ofcourse stomach's too :P) content.
Food is exceptionally amazing. To all the non-veg lovers,chicken lasagna is bae.
The rooftop ambience is amazing- especially in the evenings. The indoor seating is decent :)
4/5 because the staff aren't courteous and they dont respond quickly and we had to call them multiple times to just take the order."

3, 4, "Though the brand's famous for donuts, I'd have to start the review with their Burger. After having got bored with McD, KFC and other popular burger places, DD's burgers are just stunning. Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"

2, 3, "I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."

Ambience: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
One of the best places with great ambience in the city. The place is dim lighted but not too dark. It's the perfect place to hang out in the evening for a drink.

Food: 🌟🌟🌟
The place will serve you with a good buffet. A series of starters and main courses and desserts are just awesome here. Just make sure you are not late as the buffet strictly closes at 3:00 pm.

Hospitality: 🌟🌟🌟🌟

The staff is well trained to manage the crowd and at making you feel good."

3, 4, "Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.

One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.

Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!

We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!

Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!

Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!

Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!

That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!

I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!

Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!"

We first started off with Yakhni shorba which is a mutton soup. Then we tried few starters Daawat khaas-Murg sholay kebab, Phuket fish, Wok tossed chicken, Sikanderi raan and Daawat khaas- Chelo kebab.
Then we tried main course Nalli gosht and Murgh lababdar with bread, Murg musallam and Hyderabadi mutton biryani.
Then the mocktails Virgin mojito, Mojito fantasy(strawberry), coolers(coconut, cucumber, lime, mint), Mango mule, Blue hawaii, Soda fountain.
We ended our day with the desserts Shahi tukda and phirni."
3, 2, "This is a small Punjabi cuisine restaurant where we went for dinner. 'dahi ke kawab' was awesome. Also the paneer lababdar was delicious. We didn't like the rotis much. The naan was little thicker than it should be, and the lachha paratha was more oily. But overall we liked the food. The service is also good. The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.
Update:Went recently on Independence day. The paneery curry was just color and chilli powder. The paneer pieces were also very stiff. The rotis were also very rubbery."

We ordered #north #indian #thali, which was yummy. It covered a good mix of curries.

- cereals, breads, pastries

-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema
- cheese and cold cuts
- fresh fruits
I have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.

Service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. I won’t hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it!"
2, 3, "Over all good experience but

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

Pros: Price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing. The way DJ plays music is awesome, He makes even non-dancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing"

What I really liked about the place is they have round about 42 screens and no matter where you sit you will have 5-6 screens which will be clearly visible.
No fight or waiting to get place near to the screen.

We went here during IPL screening.
It was really a great experience.

What we had ordered was ultimate nachos,chicken wings with Chipotle sauce and pizza.

Everything was really delicious.

Portion were quite good for two.

I feel it's bit over priced but worth it..!!

Panner majestic - it was more sour and tangy in taste.
Nijam handi recommended by waiter- it was okay

Kothimeera butter roti - this one is good and light.

Ambiance:3/5 is alright.
Service :5/5 it was GOOOODD (papu served us)"
1, 2, "The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of "FRESH" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I’d complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush."

The second time I ordered it, the quantity was very less compared to the first time and tasted different as well. I've got the same sort of feedback from friends also, that their food is inconsistent in taste, quantity and its a hit or miss. I would sincerely suggest them to be consistent in quality and quantity both as they've got good potential."

Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!! Not a highly preferred place, however, you can visit for the experience of high end hospitality!"

The staff specially Akash needs to be applauded, very enthusiastic and customer focused. The starters were good, very spicy but he got us a fresh set mildly spiced even without we making a request. We were not happy with the main course spread, only 1 curry (chicken n paneer). Good place to hang out with friends for a cocktail and some delicious starters."

I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took "Rogue" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.
I would really want Club Rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and I think the same was felt by so many people over there."

Very poor"

The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don’t like sweet dishes. May be it’s the authentic Orange Chicken)
All together good experience. Staff is also very courteous and professional."
3, 2, "I had ordered Manchow Soup. The taste was very nice. It felt like a great start . Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup, chicken was cooked well, overall a very good subtle starter. The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I've tasted,was kinda smoky, chicken was cooked very well. the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing,cooked to perfection. Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird. The chicken fried rice was not that great too . It had good aroma and aura but taste was average . The restaurant had good ambience. Overall it was good experience"

Good for families who like to spend with their loved ones. and about food I liked cube corn in veg and fish, chicken & prawns in NV. I loved the mutton curry, it was so tender and delicious. And other items were ok. One thing they need to improve is service, though we opted for buffet they were serving starters at table that too with damn slow service and with repeated reminders.

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you’re interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!"

Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place."

For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served.

3, 4, "So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings❤️😍
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ❤️
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ❤️❤️ A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. 😍 The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

Taste wise : 4.5/5

Staff really needs to pickup on the service and behavior..
not at all a nice experience

Not willing to visit again..( would give 2.5 if had a choice)"

1, 2, "Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the "Signature" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."
3, 4, "Visited the clubbing section of the resturant must say ambience is too Good. Visited for ladies and bollywood night and one of the most nice DJs i could say.. Coming to drinks and they lived upto expectations.. we order Chinken Nazakat and butter garlic prawns and they were exotic and tasty...Finding these two too good went ahead with Fish Finger and kalmi Kabab.. They were good too...to scale up i would say must visit it to enjoy it."
1, 2, "I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together."
3, 4, "The best place for having authentic north indian food. Amritsari kulcha with chole, butter naan with dal makhani..you won't find it better than here. The galouti kebabs were too yummy and had the typical 'melt in mouth' functionality."
3, 4, "Nice restaurant for buffet with family and friends. There are enough options to fill your tummy with a decent price. I had been here for 4 times with friends as well as family. All the starters and main course are good in taste and quality, chicken biryani is one of the best made which I prefer to eat at least a cup only in this restaurant for buffet. You have enough deserts and salads to choose. A welcome drink which is very less in quantity but it worth to eat more 😊"

1, 0, "I would have rated a big 0 or -1 here if I can. its team lunch outing with 40 members. I'm reviewing this keeping in mind that we paid 1500 per person
Food :
there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice.
Starters : cold, not fresh, tasteless and very hard to eat. VEG: potato, Baby corn. Non-Veg : chicken, Fish
not even a smell of Prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu.
main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel
Ambience : only tables and chairs are provided. no clothes or spoons or tissues on the table. just like a road side dhaba.
Service : too slow and no up to the expectations"

2, 1, "Delivery Review :

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."
4, 3, "Must try place if you are very hungry late night ! Amazing burgers . Even their veg burger tastes so good .
Well my favourite late night joint for burgers"
2, 1, "We ordered for a margarita pizza, a brocolli-corn puff, a spinach corn sandwich, a blueberry shake, an icy latte and few cappuccinos . Apart from the cappuccinos nothing else tasted good. The bread was hard, the puff was slathered with butter, the icy latte was tasteless. The food is extremely overpriced compared to the sub standard taste."
3, 4, "Ordered Nutty Fruity Ice Cream which is mango and strawberry crazy combination and the roasted almonds which is awesome in this hot summer and the delivery boy done a great job but the packing was in plastic cover which usually delivered in Amul branding cover just saying but still i don't mind until the ice cream was good and Great Job Amul !!! Excited to have more ice creams in this hot summer."

3, 2, "This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time. The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final. The live dj was great. Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed 🍺 (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table."
3, 2, "Catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance. As this place is mainly a bar, it is not sensible to comment on the food. The spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good. Pricing is also decent."

3, 2, "Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. Following summaries my experience below-:

Ambiance- The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin. The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai. Ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5

Service- You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. It is an entirely self service type of mode. Nothing extraordinary. 3/5

Food- We tried the following two doughnuts-:

Kit kat doughnut- The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. The chocolate factor was also less. The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.

Mango doughnut- Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. Just for that 3/5.

Will I come here again? I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry. Do try that if you like strawberries."

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste."

3, 2, "Some bad donuts and some surprisingly good burgers! That pretty much sums up my experience with Dunkin Donuts. If you are bored of the usuals like McDonald’s and Burger King, do try the burgers at Dunkin Donuts and give the titular donuts a complete pass; they are dry and the toppings too sweet. I always remember the burgers from Dunkin Donuts as crisp, tasty and juicy and that’s exactly how the Big Joy Veg Burger was when I tried it last weekend. Truly a Big Joy!"
3, 2, "Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time. I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with."

Must try items here are alu kucha ,chole bahturae ,alu onion paratha and sweet lassi.

This place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here who,this place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad.

Giving 5 start only for food,do no expect any kind of ambiance , visit this place only if you eat punjabi food."

The place is not bad, easy to find, valet and comfortable seating. Service was decent as well.

Food was outrageous, the order was chicken corn & manchow soups which were ok, Prawns and teriyaki chicken which were decent but the killer was Pan Fried noodles, if you cant make it the way it is supposed to be then why keep it in the menu??

Vegetables - Baby corn, Brocolli appeared stale and they got a WIERD mushroom, which was yuckyyy to the core. I eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible.

Stay away from Pan fried!!!!"

1, 0, "I have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core!
Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!"

The ambience is amazing..and the food is awesome...
But this friday i literally came for Dj Asif Iqbal...

What a talent..
He is a rockstar
Where is ASIF IQBAL..
Hoping to see him this coming Friday..."

A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice. It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours. I absolutely loved it.
Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu. I did not find anything very special in it. Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there."
3, 4, "Wonderful restaurant! Absolutely fabulous food!

Ambience: very nice and comfy... Doesn't feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place.

Food: every morsel is heavenly! They nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself... Loved the pizzas, the fish and chips is a must order, the penne Alfredo is pretty good too... As is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish.... Absolutely delicious! Mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... Couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...

P.S. - they do have a bar but no Bira.

Service - polite. But you must be patient. Food preparation takes time. If you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.

VFM - it's an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it. He's absolutely spot on with the flavours. I would strongly recommend this restaurant. You deserve it!"

2, 1, "The ambience was good. We 12 ppl went there for dinner. Some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with Kadai murg. For starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. Starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. For biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. They told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. But the rice was sour. With biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. May b they tried to compensate. One of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 Rs.
And about the service, it was good till we pay the bill. Frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app. But they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept. Atlast though they agreed. Overall we weren't satisfied at all."
3, 4, "Visited this place a week ago with my foodie friends! They had perfect hyderabadi starters which tasted awesome!
The malai kebab, patthar ka gosht, tai pei chicken were my personal favorites!
We Also had Butter chicken and butter naan! The taste was just right! Not so spicy at all
Their biryani is famous so no doubt the biryani was exquisite!
Service was on point! And the sweets were too yumm.. The double ka meetha and mango malai are the best among them!
Highly recommend this place! For family and friends!"

When we called the manager, there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty.
The ambience is good though. If only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating.
All we ate that day was curd rice 😑 the entire team.

# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb 😒

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei " huddi" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

After finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i’ll try some more. Recommended place if you are a telangana cuisine lover."

3, 4, "Whenever i have a craving for ice creams, cream stone is the solution! I am a coffee lover so the first thing that i tried here is Coffee craze. The taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts. The next thing that i tried here is the Chocolate overdose. It's a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie. The icecreams are extremely rich and intense. Overall, i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours."
3, 4, "Have visited this place couple of times and as always their service is great and very quick. Specially their staff is very friendly and caring. Their vast buffet menu will give taste of different cuisine. Visited today for my anniversary with my parent. The service by Mr Dharma made it even great experience for them as he served their requested order very swiftly and they enjoyed the evening. Their live counter was something I loved the most. May be adding some options for veg in starter can make it better for veg folks :)"

2, 3, "Decent place with decent food items. Been here for mandhi, tasted chicken and mutton mandhi. Taste wise its 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 but rates are bit high as per me. It would be great if the management give a thought on price on food items."
2, 3, "it's OK, little spicy."
3, 4, "Starters:
🍴Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
🍴Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
🍽️ Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
🍽️ Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
🍹Summer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
🍹Fresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"
3, 0, "Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."
3, 4, "A lot of people suggested this place for some real spicy food. Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."

Ambience was ok types, not so appealing. Crockery used for service was good.
Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can’t eat.
Steam rice was salty too.
Frankly speak, we did not like food except reshami kabab. Rest of food was pathetic."

2, 1, "The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. 
Neways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.

Vikrant was very helpful in giving feedback to chef and getting less spicy food for kids...

Ambience .. Best in City!!"
2, 1, "Super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype. We ordered:
▪Mint mocha - which tasted OK
▪Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
▪Mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
▪coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
▪vegetarian cafe
▪good location
▪good music
▪they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low. There's so much competition out there, you have to rev-up your game.
Serve good food and bring your reputation up. Challenge accepted?"

Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

Used Zomato Gold here."
2, 0, "It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."
